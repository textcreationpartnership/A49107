         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>I May juſtly fear, that in the Dedication of theſe <hi>Exercitations,</hi> I have done as ſome inconſiderate Perſons, who ſeek to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe a leſs, by committing of a greater Offence: It was, I confeſs, a great Preſumption, that I prefixt your Lordſhip's Name to a <hi>Haſty Scrible</hi> againſt the <hi>Crime of Perſecution</hi> charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the <hi>Church of England;</hi> and now I preſume upon your Lordſhip's Patience and Patronage in a Caſe of greater Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; it is not a <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> nor any of the Plea's of a Temporal Crown, but a Crime <hi>Laeſae Majeſtatis,</hi> an Overt Attempt to overthrow the Crown and Kingdom of our Bleſſed Saviour; as if he alſo were a King <hi>de Facto,</hi> and not <hi>de Jure;</hi> which I now lay before your Lordſhip, it is the Crown and Dignity of him in whoſe Perſon and Due Worſhip and Honour our common Salvation is wrapt up: The Sanction of our Law, (viz.) <hi>de Heretico comburen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> was, I confeſs, too ſevere; but if there be not ſome Powerful Reſtraint laid on ſuch Damnable Hereſies as <hi>deny the LORD that bought them,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> will not forbear to deny him on Earth, with a <hi>Non Obſtante</hi> to our Saviour's threatning, <hi>Him will I deny before my Father which is in heaven:</hi> The Eccleſiaſtical Laws are but as <hi>Bruta Fulmina,</hi> to ſuch as wilfully Excommunicate themſelves; and unleſs the Temporal Power ſupply the Defects of the Spiritual, we are like to run into a worſe Confuſion than hitherto we have; this ſort of Men being as great Enemies to the one as to the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ruarus</hi> who incurred a Baniſhment for his <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> though as modeſt as any of them, in a Tract of Magiſtracy, printed with his Epiſtles, <hi>p.</hi> 461. ſays, <hi>The times may be ſuch, and if we conſider the ſtate of all Ages and Nations, they have been, and ſtill are ſuch, that it is more hard for a Chriſtian to diſcharge the Office of a Magiſtrate, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of a Supreme, than for a rich Man to enter into the kingdom of heaven.</hi> They are for an <hi>Independent Miniſtry;</hi> no Friends to either
<pb facs="tcp:59637:3"/> of our Lord's Inſtitutions, the Sacraments of <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Eucharist;</hi> and though while they are under the Power of the Civil Magiſtrate, they plead for an enlarged Charity, yet if at any time they get the Sword to hang at their ſides, their Cruelty will be much more extenſive: This I ſpeak the more poſitively, becauſe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Their Principles lead them to it; for if the Papiſts, with whom we agree in the chiefeſt Articles of Religion, be ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Enemies, as to deſign the utter Extirpation of our Church, how much more will the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who condemn us as Polytheiſts and Idolators, for worſhipping thoſe whom they account meer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, execute their Fury on us?</p>
            <p>But 2ly, their Practices have abundantly declared their Inveterate Malice, for when one <hi>Arian</hi> Presbyter had drawn <hi>Conſtantius</hi> to be of his Opinion, I tremble to relate what Havock was made in the Church; and before that time under <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> having gotten the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts and other Hereticks to ſtrengthen their Party, they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more Outrages on the Catholicks than <hi>Diocleſian</hi> himſelf, though that was the <hi>fluctus Decumanus,</hi> the moſt impetuous Wave that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed the Church: I ſhall give a brief Account from a Witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Exceptions, <hi>Vincent Lirinenſis,</hi> Ch. 6. <hi>Contr.

<pb facs="tcp:59637:3"/> while they are under ſevere Laws, that I believe, if their Power were equal, it would be as well for our Temporal as Spiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to live under the <hi>Roman,</hi> as the <hi>Racovian</hi> Harrows.</p>
            <p>The Statute 29 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. which abrogated that <hi>De Heretico Combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendo,</hi> declares, <hi>That it doth not take away or abridge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Iuriſdiction of Proteſtant Archbiſhops, Biſhops, or other Iudges of his Majeſty's Eccleſiaſtical Courts, in Cauſes of Atheiſm, Blaſphemy, Hereſie, Schiſm, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Damnable Doctrines or Opinions; but they may proceed to puniſh the ſame according to the Eccleſiaſtical Laws, by Excommunication, Deprivation, Degradati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and other Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, not extending to Death.</hi> So as before the Act, the Learned Judge <hi>Hales,</hi> in the beginning of his Plea's of the Crown, gives an Account of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Conviction of Hereticks, which he ſays, is, <hi rend="margSglQuotes">
                  <hi>First,</hi> By the Common Law. (Whereof he gives ſome Inſtances.) <hi>Secondly,</hi> By Archbiſhops and Biſhops in a General Synod. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By the Biſhop in his Dioceſs. The Common Law, he ſays, inflicts no Forfeiture, neither indeed doth the Eccleſiaſtical, if the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal abjure his Opinions, being <hi>pro ſalute Animae,</hi> but if he relapſed after Abjuration, he is left in a worſe condition. The matter of Hereſie was to be judged of by the Canonical Scripture: Or, 2. By what hath been determined by the four General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. 3. By any General council according to expreſs Scripture. 4. By Parliament, with Aſſent of the Convocation.</hi> What Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er your Lordſhip hath over the Head or Members of <hi>Exeter</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in caſe of Hereſie, I refer to their Statutes.</p>
            <p>What Operation theſe Methods may effect, I know not, but there needs a ſpeedy Application, where the Gangreen gains ſo viſibly, and may be ſo mortal: But why talk I thus to ſo great a Maſter in our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who hath a more perfect knowledge of all thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſpeak? Your Lordſhip hath been a conſtant and eminent Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Faith eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof is that of the Ever Bleſſed Trinity, on which all our Worſhip, and all our Hopes are built; but ungodly Men have in this too licentious Age, endeavoured with all their Might and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty to ſubvert this Foundation: and that which hath cauſed this Addreſs to your Lordſhip, is a holy Indignation, when I conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there are more who appear in Print to deſtroy, than to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh this Foundation, which hath cauſed me, though the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of many Thouſands, (that my Zeal may provoke others, that have more Knowledge and Abilities) to ſolicite the Cauſe of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>MAreſius</hi> in the Preface to the Second Part of his <hi>Hydra Socin.</hi> takes notice of the Printing in <hi>England, Anno 1654.</hi> The <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian Catechiſm</hi> of <hi>John Beedle,</hi> Maſter of Arts, containing all the Impieties and Blaſphemies of <hi>Socinus;</hi> to which he ſays was added a Catalogue of <hi>Socinian</hi> Books; his Twelve Reaſons against the Deity of the Holy Ghost, and the Life of <hi>Fauſtus Socinus:</hi> and that Learned Man thus complains of it, <hi>O the deplorable Condition of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>which having driven out their King, now conſtrains the King of Kings to be baniſhed, and ſeems to have no greater value for that Liberty which was purchaſed by Chriſt's Blood, than to obtain a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe of Hearing, Writing, and Believing what they pleaſe.</hi> If this were a Scandal to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation in thoſe lawleſs Times, and gave ſo great an offence to foreign Divines, How much more will the Offence and Scandal be, when the <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſhall be ſent <hi>naked</hi> abroad, by the hands of a <hi>Doctor of Divinity,</hi> and <hi>Rector of a Colledge,</hi> and one that writes himſelf a <hi>True Son of the Church of</hi> England; eſpecially conſidering, that we have now a Proteſtant King and Queen, (whom God long preſerve) Defenders of the Ancient Catholick Faith, which hath been ſo long profeſſed in the Church.</p>
            <p>It is greatly to be deplored, that the <hi>Racovian</hi> Catechiſm is ſo commonly ſold both in <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as is <hi>Crellius</hi> alſo, and <hi>Beedle</hi>'s Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, and his Arguments against the Deity of the Holy Ghost. And lately, a Swarm of Pamphlets, like venomous Inſects, in all parts of the Land, of <hi>Theiſts, Anti-Trinitarians, Unitarians, Arians,</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as much as they may, the Light of the Goſpel, and poyſoning the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grotius,</hi> in his Vindication of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> profeſſeth, that he knew not one in all the Aſſembly of the States, that was not ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce an <hi>Anathema,</hi> as well to the old Doctrines of <hi>Samoſatenus,</hi> as to the new of <hi>Socinus,</hi> againſt the Conſubſtantial, and unconfuſed and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Trinity; yet at that time, the Hereſie of <hi>Servetus</hi> had taken root and
<pb facs="tcp:59637:5"/> ſpread itſelf ſecretly among very many, ſo that he himſelf, to avoid ſuſpicion of being a Patron to them, thought fit to write his Book of the <hi>Satisfaction of Chriſt;</hi> and we have this Expreſſion in his Book, <hi>De Pietate Ordinum Holland. Seeing that Hereſie is the Poyſon of the Church, and is quick in its Operation, and there are certain Degrees of Hereſie, one being more hurtful than another, there cannot be found any that is worſe than the Hereſie of</hi> Socinus, <hi>at the mentioning whereof all good men do tremble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have reaſon to bleſs God, that in ſuch lioentious Times as we have ſeen in the former Age, when a General Toleration was granted, and all ſort of Hereſies were impunely permitted, and Orthodox Doctrines diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced, there are ſo few perſons infected with Hereſie, and ſo many learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons left us to vindicate the Truths of the Goſpel; yet are there ſome Thouſands infected with <hi>Anabaptiſm,</hi> and <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> among whom the <hi>Pelagian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrines have got the Aſcendent. They talked formerly of being Godded with God, and Chriſted with Chriſt; and now they deny the Godhead of Chriſt; and Man it with Man: what number of ſuch Hereticks are now among us, the Author of the <hi>NAKED GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPEL</hi> may know better than others; doubtleſs he preſumes of a large Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, otherwiſe he would not appear as a Leader to head them; but that he ſhould appear under the Notion of a <hi>Son of the Church of</hi> England, is the greateſt Affront that could be done it; for as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays, <hi>he had rather Men ſhould ſay, there was never ſuch a Man as</hi> Plutarch, <hi>than that they ſhould ſay he was a Vicious Perſon:</hi> So is it a leſs reproach for the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to ſay, there never was ſuch a Church as the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> than to ſay it is a Church profeſſing <hi>Pelagian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. The Fathers and Sons of our Church, have not, and by the Grace of God will not be wanting in their Duty to Aſſert her Doctrines, and to Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence all her Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>The Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> have manifeſted their Abhorrence of it, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the Book to the Fire: And the Right Reverend the Biſhop of <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Viſitor of that Colledge, whereof the Author was Rector, hath (as the Statutes of the Colledge directed him in Caſe of Hereſie) very ſeaſonably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premanded him, whereby it is hoped the Gangreen of his Hereſies will be mortified and cut off from infecting the Members of that Famous Colledge. Nor do I doubt but all that have any Authority in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, will ſhew the like Deteſtation of that Damnable Hereſie, that <hi>denieth the Lord that bought them.</hi> The Ancient Fathers were very ſevere againſt ſuch; <hi>Ignatius,</hi> mentioning that paſſage in <hi>Jer. 17. Curſed is the man that truſteth in man,</hi> ſaith, <hi>that they are under the Curſe, that affirm Chriſt to be a meer man.</hi> Origen, <hi>on</hi> Job, l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>4. Whatever men ſhall do without Faith in the Holy Trinity, they do in vain, and
<pb facs="tcp:59637:5"/> ſhall have no reward.</hi> Fulgentius de fide, <hi>p. 9.</hi> ſaith, <hi>he cannot be a Chriſtian, that ſhall not confeſs the Lord Chriſt to be his God.</hi> The Fathers have ſaid as much concerning the <hi>Arians,</hi> that they were Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtians rather than Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Yea, they ſay the like of <hi>Arius</hi> as of <hi>Julian,</hi> That they were both guilty of the Sin against the Holy Ghost; and if to the rest of our National Sins, we ſhould add this, to ſuffer the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity to be thus pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly derided, and made the Subject of profane Pamphlets; that the Writers ſhould confidently own them, and falſely profeſs themſelves Sons of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> that there ſhould be a Secret Preſs ſtill in Labour to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſuch Monſters; that there ſhould be a Club to Father them, and ſuch Hectors to defend and ſupport them, and ſo many to applaud them; and ſuch Books as were long ſince written in <hi>Latin,</hi> are taught to ſpeak <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French;</hi> and our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Books in requital, are taught to ſpeak <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>French Arrianiſm,</hi> is one of the great Provocations for which the Lord's hand is not withdrawn, but is ſtill ſtretched out to be avenged on us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> on his Death bed, was wont to exhort thoſe who came to viſit him, <hi>Oremus pro Domino, noſtro &amp; ejus Evangelio:</hi> Let us pray for our Lord, and for his Goſpel. The Goſpel was then reviving, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its liberty, it is now impriſoned in all Countries where Popery doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, and it is like to be ſtript Naked at home, if ſome charitable Hand doth not ſeaſonably prevent it; to which, that Doom which our Saviour hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, <hi>Mat. 25.43. Go ye curſed; for I was naked, and ye cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me not,</hi> ſhould excite every good Chriſtian; otherwiſe we may juſtly fear, that for all the Affronts and Indignities which the Prophane on the one hand, and the Hereticks and Blaſphemers on the other hand, between whom our bleſſed Saviour is crucified afreſh, and put to open ſhame, he deal with us, as he did with the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Rev. <hi>2.5. I will come unto thee quickly, and remove thy Candleſtick; except thou repent.</hi> And the great haſte which ſo many do make to baniſh the true knowledge of God out of the Land, is a fearful Prognoſtick, that our Saviour will come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to be avenged on ſuch a People.</p>
            <p>My preſent Undertaking is only to do the Office of a Watch-man, or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel, to diſcover the approach of an Adverſary, and to ſound an Alarme to ſuch as are better furniſhed with Arms and Abilities to vanquiſh them, of which by the Bleſſing of God, our Church is provided with many thouſands, who, I doubt not, will fight it out, <hi>Uſ<expan>

<pb facs="tcp:59637:6"/> of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, and of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> which have been recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> not only from them, but from the most Primitive Times: But the Doctor ſays, <hi>We have no firm ground to go upon; not from Scripture, becauſe the</hi> Arrians <hi>capt Scripture with the Orthodox; nor from Antiquity, which they claimed with the ſame confidence; nor from Councils, which determined ſometimes on one ſide, and ſometimes on the other.</hi> p. <hi>37.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi> Yet he grants, that the Catholicks have the advantage of long poſſeſſion, and that after Sentence; and at laſt leaves both the <hi>Arrian</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Doctrines on the ſame level with <hi>Roman</hi> Impoſitions, equally unworthy of our Faith or Study. By this, and what I ſhall further urge from the <hi>Naked Goſpel,</hi> it will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, that if the Doctor be of any Religion, that names the Name of Christ, he must be a <hi>Socinian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Author's deſign, he pretends it to be, <hi>1.</hi> For the enlarging of Charity; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> for a Toleration of his Opinions.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> To prevent Impoſitions in Matters of Faith, to both which I have replyed, and ſhewn, that the real deſign is to ridicule the <hi>Athanaſian Creed,</hi> and the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and to prefer a Natural Religion, above that which is taught by them, which he accounts among his unreaſonable Impoſitions; as having <hi>1.</hi> No footing in Scripture; in anſwer whereto, I have ſhewn the Harmony of the Old and New Teſtament, in Confirmation of thoſe Doctrines. <hi>2.</hi> Whereas he ſays, they have no Foundation in the Fathers, I have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their Authorities. And thirdly, as for the Councils, Becauſe the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> decline their Authority, I have but briefly toucht them. As to my Method, having first conſidered his Preface, in the next place I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered his Apology. <hi>3.</hi> I have made ſome general Reflections on the Book; and laſtly, I have diſcovered what <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrines are covertly deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in each Chapter; for I find his Oracles, like thoſe of old, to carry a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or double Sence, to be as a Reſerve and Refuge, that being driven from the one, he might flye to the other; and indeed it is more difficult to diſcover and draw him forth from thoſe Ambuſhes wherein he lies in wait to deceive, than to baffle his greatest Strength in a plain and open Field; the first is my chief endeavour, though I have not on occaſion declined the other: what I have attempted was not in confidence of my own Abilities, having never been exerciſed in this ſpiny Controverſie, and being now by Age, <hi>Miles emeritus;</hi> but only to excite and provoke others to contend for the common Salvation in the Faith once delivered to the Saints; and whatever the ſucceſs be, I hope I ſhall obtain the Pardon of all good Men, ſeeing I have according to my power caſt in my Mite into the Church's Treaſury.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER To a Late TREATISE, ENTITULED, <hi>The Naked Goſpel.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Author of the <hi>Naked Goſpel</hi> calls himſelf a true Son of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> now the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is declared in her Liturgy, her Articles, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; in her Liturgy ſhe hath inſerted the Three Creeds, <hi>viz.</hi> that called the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the <hi>Nicene,</hi> and the <hi>Athanaſian;</hi> theſe two laſt our Author would have to be reſtrained to the Letter of the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, becauſe that only is uſed in the Offices for Adminiſtration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and Viſitation of the Sick; but if he be a true Son of the Church, he hath or ſhould, <hi>ex animo,</hi> have given his Aſſent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to all the Doctrines avowed by the Church. However, it is well that the Doctor ſeems to approve of the Apoſtles Creed, becauſe I find the <hi>Socinians</hi> deny the Godhead of the Son and Holy Ghoſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is not expreſly affirmed in that Creed, yet certainly they had not been made Objects of our Faith, if they were not of the Godhead. This Creed is but a larger Profeſſion of our Chriſtian Faith, which we made at our Baptiſm, where we dedicate ourſelves to the Service of that one God who is Father Son and Holy Ghoſt. The Right Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> hath ſufficiently proved the Deity of the Son and Holy Ghoſt, in his learned Expoſition of that Creed: Nor have we ever heard of any of the Fathers that have interpreted it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59637:7"/> than as the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creeds have done; yet I have been credibly informed, that a Doctor, who ſtiles himſelf of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> gravely declared, That this Creed alſo might be reformed. But in the Church of <hi>England</hi> we find the reiterated Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the Bleſſed Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, ſo in the Doxology, in the Form uſed in Baptiſm, and in the Litany, <hi>O Holy, Bleſſed and Glorious Trinity, Three Perſons and One God,</hi> &amp;c And in that very ancient Hymn after the Communion, it is ſaid of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Thou only art Holy, thou only art the Lord; thou only O Christ, with the Holy Ghost, art moſt high in the Glory of God the Father.</hi> In the <hi>Te Deum, Thou art the King of Glory O Christ; thou art the Everlaſting Son of the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt Article concerning the Trinity, the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſays, That <hi>in the Unity of the Divine Nature, there are three Perſons of the ſame Eſſence, Power and Eternity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</hi> In the Homely for <hi>Whitſunday</hi> ſhe ſays, <hi>The Holy Ghost is a Spiritual and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Subſtance, the third Perſon in the Deity, diſtinct from the Father and the Son;</hi> Which thing may moſt eaſily be proved, by moſt plain Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of God's Holy Word.</p>
            <p>

            <p>It was therefore a <hi>Proteſtatio contra factum,</hi> to ſtile himſelf a true Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and under that Title to publiſh to the World what is ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to her Doctrine: May not the Church complain of ſuch Sons in the words of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> c. 1. <hi>I have nouriſhed and brought up children, and they have rebelled againſt me?</hi> But God be thanked, the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth not want more dutiful Sons, ſuch as on all occaſions are ready and able to vindicate her Doctrines, and aſſert her Diſcipline: That famous Univerſity, whereof the Author was a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſeaſonably manifeſted her Deteſtation of his Heretical Opinions, by condemning them to the Flames, that there might not be a Spark left to kindle ſuch dangerous Fires in the Church; which Decree, for the Reader's ſatisfaction, is here inſerted:

                  <hi>Whether</hi> Mahomet <hi>or Chriſtian Doctors have more corrupted the Goſpel, is not ſo plain by the light of Scripture, as it is by that of Experience, that the later gave occaſion, encouragement, and advantage to the former. For when by nice and hot Diſputes, (eſpecially concerning the Second and Third Perſons of the Trinity) the minds of the whole People had been long confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by the then late Eſtabliſhment of Image-Worſhip, the Scandal was encreaſed, ſo that to vulgar Underſtandings the Doctrine of the Trinity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared no leſs guilty of Polytheiſm, then that of Image-Worſhip did of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try—Then was there a tempting Opportunity offered to the Impoſtor, and he laid hold on it, to ſet up himſelf for a Reformer of ſuch Corruptions, as were both too groſs to be juſtified, and too viſible to be denyed.</hi>

               <p>Cap. 8. pag. 46. <hi>Two Evangeliſts trace our Lord's Genealogy; but as they derive it not from his real but ſuppoſed Father, ſo do they take two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways, not to ſatisfie but to amuſe us. What is this but to admoniſh us againſt Curioſity? The Pedigree of his Fleſh might eaſily have been, either cleared or unmentioned: Had the Evangeliſts been wholly ſilent concerning it, we had leſs wondred; but that they ſhould profeſs to inſtruct us, yet doubly diſappoint us, firſt by deriving it from a wrong Father, and then by diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting us between two ways; What is this but to verify the Prophets deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Who ſhall declare his Generation? <hi>And what doth this ſo careful Concealment of his Generation according to the Humane Nature ſignify more plainly, than a warning againſt ſearching after his Eternal Generation of his Divinity? If it were needleſs (and therefore left impoſſible) to prove him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from</hi> David, <hi>which was one of his moſt revealed Characters; how can it be otherwiſe, to underſtand that Generation of his, which muſt needs be ſo much the more above our Underſtanding, as the Nature of God is above our own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pag. 48. <hi>And might not a Heathen at this rate juſtify Polytheiſm, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided his Gods diſagreed not among themſelves? The Schoolmen therefore will not ſtand to this State of the Queſtion, but diſtinguiſh between</hi> Perſon <hi>and</hi> ſuppoſitum rationale; <hi>which (yet) they cannot ſo do, as to ſatisfy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and therefore ſhelter themſelves in their impregnable Fort,</hi> Myſtery, <hi>and thence thunder upon the Adverſaries both of this, and of another no leſs beloved</hi> Myſtery: <hi>For they make this their Cock argument for Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation; That ſince the Scripture is no leſs expreſs for the One than the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Contradictions no leſs groſs in the One than in the Other; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt embrace the one as well as the other.</hi>

                  <hi>To this Objection of the</hi> Romaniſts, <hi>and to others of the</hi> Unitarians, <hi>we have found an Anſwer, That we muſt not infer from our Own Nature to God's; for that Ours is finite, and God's is infinite; Three Perſons among Us are Three Men, becauſe they agree in one Common Nature; but the Divine Nature is not a Common One, but a Singular; and therefore Three Perſons do not make Three Gods.

               <p>Pag. 54. <hi>The only advantage of the Catholicks is long Poſſeſſion, and that after Sentence— They have indeed ſo handled Matters, as to hide much, and varniſh all; yet even ſo, we may pick out enough to juſtify an Appeal, by obſerving how that Poſſeſſion was firſt obtained, then continued, and at laſt ſetled— The Sentence which firſt determined the Controverſy</hi> [in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice] was not by the Merit of the Cauſe, but Intereſt of the Parties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pag. 56. <hi>This long and miſcheivous Controverſy was at laſt ſetled by</hi> Theodoſius; <hi>who having received his Inſtructions and Baptiſm from a Conſubſtantialiſt, required all his Subjects to conform to that Religion, which</hi> Peter <hi>the Prince of the Apoſtles from the beginning had delivered to the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, <hi>and which at that time</hi> Damaſus <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and</hi> Peter <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Alexandria <hi>held; and that Church only ſhould be eſteemed Catholick which worſhipped the Divine Trinity with equal Honour; and thoſe which held the other ſhould be called Hereticks, made infamous, and puniſhed.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>This therefore we may call ſetling the Controverſy; becauſe thenceforth all ſucceeding Emperors, and Biſhops wrote after this Copy, and both the Parties have ever worn theſe Titles, which the Emperor by his Imperial Power, as the unqueſtionable Fountain of Honor, was pleaſed to beſtow upon them. —Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold now the Ground upon which one of our Fundamental Articles of Faith is Built; behold the Juſtice of that Plea, which from ſuch a Poſſeſſion would preſcribe to our Belief.</hi>

Pag. 59]</p>
               <p>Pag. 58. <hi>The</hi> Athanaſians <hi>abhor Polytheiſm, no leſs than do the</hi> Arrians. <hi>If their Poſitions ſeem to infer it, they deny the conſequence; if this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Rules of reaſoning, they avow it; for they allow Reaſon no hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Myſteries of Faith: if this make them Hereticks, it is not in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but in Logick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>On the other ſide, the</hi> Arrians <hi>profeſs to believe of Christ whatever him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or his Apoſtles have ſpoken; and where one expreſſion in Scripture ſeemeth to contradict another, they take ſuch a Courſe to reconcile them, as the Laws and Cuſtoms of all the World direct. It is very frequent for Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick to exceed, but never to diminiſh the Grammatical Character of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whoſe honour the Writer profeſſeth to advance: and upon this account they think it more reaſonable, that thoſe Expreſſions which exalt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Perſon to an Equality with the Father, ſhould ſtoop to thoſe which ſpeak him Inferior; than that thoſe which ſpeak him Inferior ſhould be ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to thoſe which ſpeak him Equal. And however, this is the ſafer Way; ſince it will lead us to ſuch a Belief, as will ſuffice for that end, for whoſe ſake alone Belief itſelf is required.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The very mentioning of theſe Opinions is a ſufficient Confutation to all ſuch as have heartily imbraced the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But the Author, in his Vindication, pretends, that what he hath written was only to enlarge Charity, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to procure a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59637:10"/> of ſuch Opinions as he hath publiſhed: I ſhall only diſcover that Line of <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> much blacker than his Ink, which runs through his whole Book, and then the Reader may judge to what his inlarged Charity doth tend.</p>
               <p>The Deſign of the Preface is to ſhew, ſaith the Doctor, that the Succeſs of the Goſpel, which made ſuch great Conqueſts at firſt, hath been hindred by the difference of the Modern Goſpel from the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive, in its Doctrine, which difference, he ſays, is ſo great, <hi>that if an Apoſtle ſhould return into the World, he would be ſo far from owning it, that he would not be able to underſtand it.</hi>

                  <hi>beſides what we have received, let him be accurſed.</hi> I hope therefore the Doctor doth not think of ſetting up any other Judge of Controverſies than what the Church, whereof he calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a True Son, doth own and profeſs; if the Succeſs of it hath been hindred in any Age, it may not be imputed to the Doctrine therein delivered, nor to the Providence of God, in preſerving it intire, but to thoſe falſe and contrary Doctrines, which by the Inſtruments of Satan, transforming themſelves into Angels of Light, endeavoured to deſtroy in its infancy, ſuch as <hi>St. Peter</hi> calls <hi>damnable errors,</hi> denying the Lord that bought them, and teaching that Jeſus Chriſt was no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> come in the fleſh; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> that God the Word was not made fleſh, but the fleſh was made God. Such were <hi>Ebion</hi> a Jew, <hi>Cerinthus</hi> and <hi>Marcion,</hi> who ſpread their Errors againſt the Deity of Chriſt, while <hi>St. John</hi> was living, with which Errors the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was ſo infeſted, that ſhe beſought <hi>St. John</hi> to write in confutation of them, as he did both in his Goſpel and Epiſtles. The other Apoſtles were diligent in confuting the Errors of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> who would have brought in the worſhipping of Saints and Angels as inferior Gods. Theſe generally condemned <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, and kept to the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Obſervations, which (the Apoſtles wrote againſt) the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> alſo mentioned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.6. were of the like Opinion with the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus.</hi> For hating of whoſe Deeds the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is commended. <hi>Ireneus,</hi> l. 3. c. 11. ſays, <hi>that St.</hi> John <hi>wrote his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to deſtroy that Error which had been ſown by</hi> Cerinthus, <hi>and before him by the</hi> Nicolaitans. So that the Succeſs of the Goſpel was hindred by not only thoſe falſe Doctrines, but the impure Lives of the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59637:10"/> and <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> whoſe deeds God hated. <hi>Mahomet</hi> was of the ſame Opinion with thoſe Hereticks; for though the Doctor ſays, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, yet it's evident he denied the Deity of Chriſt, though he owned him to be a true Prophet and Meſſenger of God; in which reſpect (the Doctor might ſay) he owned as much of the Chriſtian Faith as the <hi>Socinians</hi> do, and we may ſay he was for a <hi>Naked Goſpel</hi> as well as the Doctor.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion therefore which the Doctor makes, whether <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> or Chriſtian Doctors have more corrupted the Goſpel and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the ſucceſs of it, is eaſily reſolved; for the <hi>Gnoſticks, Cerinthians, Ebionites,</hi> &amp;c. all which called themſelves Chriſtian Doctors and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of the Goſpel, as he calls <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Were thoſe Chriſtian Doctors, who by their corrupt and Antichriſtian Errors, defamed the Goſpel, and oppoſed the Deity of its Author? And theſe and ſuch others made way for <hi>Mahomet,</hi> by ſhewing, that they held a Goſpel, whereof every Article was to be found in the <hi>Alchoran.</hi> And had our Doctor lived in the days of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> it's not unlike but he might have been one of thoſe Chriſtian Doctors, that would have reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpels according to the <hi>Alchoran.</hi> As for any new Additions or Impoſitions in Matters of Faith, the Doctor knows the Church of <hi>England</hi> utterly diſclaims them. And to avoid ſuch traditionary Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, the Church of <hi>England</hi> (retaining whatſoever is agreeable to the Scriptures and Primitive Churches,) hath reformed herſelf from all the corrupt Innovations and Impoſitions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well in Matters of Doctrine as of Government and Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>And now to the Doctor's Queſtion, <hi>Whether</hi> Mahomet <hi>or the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctors have more corrupted the Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This was the Tempting Opportunity (ſays the Doctor) offered to the Impoſtor, and he laid hold on it, to ſet up himſelf for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former. Sir <hi>W. Temple,</hi> p. 107. of the Second Part of his <hi>Eſſays,</hi> may inform him who was the fore-runner of Anti-Chriſt, as the Fathers termed <hi>Arius.</hi> About the Year 600, the time when <hi>Mahomet</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, the Provinces of the Eaſt were over-run with <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> who denied or undermined the Divinity of Chriſt, and allowed only his Prophetical Office. The Countries of <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> were filled with great numbers of the ſcattered <hi>Jews,</hi> who on the deſtruction of their Country in <hi>Adrian</hi>'s time, had fled into theſe Provinces, to avoid the utter ruine of their Nation, threatned by that Emperour. <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> were inhabited by <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were given to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Riches. <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to humour and comply with theſe three ſorts of men, and by aſſiſtance of <hi>Sergius</hi> a Monk (an <hi>Arian</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,) who fearing the Cenſure of the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59637:11"/> then reſolved to ſuppreſs that, and the Hereſie of the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> fled into <hi>Arabia,</hi> and was entertained by <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Maſter, where he grew into acquaintance with <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and became his only Confident, framed a Scheme of Religion which might take in the common Opinions and Diſpoſitions of all thoſe three Parties, which yet might be agreeable to his own temper and deſigns. He profeſſed One God, Creator of the World, and that God ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> his firſt and great Prophet, to give his Laws to Mankind, which were not obeyed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Gentiles, therefore in later Ages he ſent Chriſt, who was the ſecond Prophet, and greater than <hi>Moſes,</hi> to preach his Laws in greater purity, but to do it with gentleneſs, patience, and humility, which found no better reception or ſucceſs among Men, than <hi>Moſes</hi> had done; and therefore God had now ſent his laſt and greateſt Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to publiſh his Laws with more Power, to ſubdue them by Force and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, who would not willingly receive them; that ſuch as would not obey, ſhould be ruined; but the obedient ſhould have the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his, and their Enemies, as a Reward in this Life, and a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe hereafter, with all ſenſual enjoyments, eſpecially of beautiful Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, newly created for that purpoſe: theſe prevailed with <hi>Arians, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in thoſe parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it appears, what this Reformer was, and what were the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting opportunities which he laid hold on.</p>
               <p>To pleaſe the <hi>Jews, Mahomet</hi> obſerved Circumciſion, in imitation of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and recommended to them the Laws of <hi>Moſes;</hi> to pleaſe the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he permitted Polygamy, to the number of four Wives, and as many Concubines as they could maintain; and to pleaſe the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> he permitted them to have a <hi>Naked Goſpel,</hi> and a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Faith in Chriſt, as a Meſſenger of GOD, greater than <hi>Moſes;</hi> but not God, or the Saviour of the World; for they deny that he was crucified, but was taken up alive into Heaven: but theſe are not all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, he denied the Crucifixion of our Saviour, his Reſurrection, Aſcention, and that he ſhould come to Judge the World, to reward or puniſh Men according to their Works. <hi>Sandius,</hi> p. 347. mentioneth ſome other of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Doctrines: As that God is One both in Eſſence and Perſon, and that there are not Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; that Chriſt is to be worſhipped, but not with that Divine Worſhip as his Lord and God is: He ſays, That <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and every one that worſhippeth and feareth God, and doth Good Works, may be ſaved; and he quotes <hi>Baronius,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That the</hi> Mahomitans <hi>do worſhip Christ, as the</hi> Arrians <hi>and</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians <hi>do,</hi> p. 348.</p>

               <p>The Author of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Life, Printed before the <hi>Engliſh Alchoran,</hi> ſays, <hi>He was ordained to be a Scourge for the Chriſtians, who in multitudes at that time, had forſaken the Truth, to follow the Sects and Hereſies of the</hi> Arrians, Neſtorians, Donatiſts, <hi>and others.</hi> By ſuch as theſe, the Candleſtick, by God's juſt Judgment, was removed out of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches at firſt; and the pure Light of the Goſpel is much dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in theſe later Ages, by <hi>Anti-Trinitarians, Servetians,</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> who have well nigh extinguiſhed that Goſpel, which is the Light of the World, and would leave Mankind as naked, and as much aſhamed as our firſt Parents, when they had eaten of the forbidden Fruit.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, that when I firſt read, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> profeſt all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Chriſt's Faith, I was not aware, that the Doctor might mean according to his New Goſpel, or the <hi>Socinian</hi> Creed; but on enquiry into the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> and computation of Time, when the <hi>Alchoran</hi> was written, <hi>(viz)</hi> about the year 600, before which time the whole World, as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> obſerved, was become <hi>Arrian;</hi> and <hi>Sergius</hi> the Monk, that had a chief hand in contriving it, was an <hi>Arrian,</hi> I found that the Doctor makes a very great Agreement in Matters of Faith, between the <hi>Alchoran</hi> and his <hi>Naked Goſpel;</hi> ſo that as he ſays, <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſet up for a Reformer of the Goſpel in his time; ſo we have another <hi>Sergeus</hi> who ſets up for a Reformer of the Goſpel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Alchoran</hi> in our time, as by the following particulars will appear.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh Alchoran,</hi> as it is Reprinted 1688, (is that which I quote) <hi>p.</hi> 3. ſpeaking to the Chriſtians: <hi>Mahomet,</hi> ſays, <hi>Say not God hath a Companion equal to him, becauſe you know the contrary.</hi> P. 4. <hi>God created the Heavens and the Earth, and then aſcended into Heaven.</hi> P. 44. Zachary <hi>prayed to God for a Progeny, the Angels declared to him from God, That he ſhould have a Son called</hi> John, <hi>he ſhall affirm the</hi> Meſſias <hi>to be the Word of God; Jeſus is with God, as is</hi> Adam, <hi>God created him out of the Earth; I do not aſſociate (God) him with any one, and acknowledge no other Lord but him.</hi> P. 46. <hi>There is no God, but God alone, the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent and Wiſe.</hi> P. 86. <hi>There be ſome that alter the Scripture in reading it, and will make us believe that what we read is in the Scripture, though it be not; they blaſpheme, and know it well: God gave not to Men the Scripture, Knowledge, and Propheſies, to ſay to the People, Worſhip me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of God; but that they ſhould ſay, Obſerve exactly what you read in the Scripture: God doth not command you to adore Angels or Prophets.</hi> P. 48. <hi>We believe in what was inſpired by</hi> Moſes, Jeſus, <hi>and generally by all the Prophets:</hi> Abraham <hi>was not of them that believe in many Gods.</hi> P. 49. <hi>Follow ye the Law of</hi> Abraham, <hi>that is pleaſing to him; he profest the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Divine Majeſty; he was not of them that believe in many Gods.</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59637:12"/> P. 94. <hi>Certainly they that believe</hi> Meſſias, <hi>the Son of</hi> Mary, <hi>to be God, are impious. The</hi> Meſſias <hi>commanded the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to worſhip God, his, and their Lord. Paradiſe is forbidden to him that ſhall ſay, God hath a Companion equal to him. Such as affirm, there are Three Gods, are impious.</hi> P. 86. <hi>The</hi> Meſſias, <hi>the Son of</hi> Mary, <hi>is a Prophet and Apoſtle of God, like to the Prophets that came before him: His Mother is Holy, ſay to him, Who can hinder God to extirminate the</hi> Meſſias, <hi>and his Mother.</hi> P. 86. <hi>Of the</hi> Jews, he ſays, <hi>few of them ſhall believe, becauſe of their Malice and Blaſphemies vomited againſt</hi> Mary. <hi>They ſaid, We have ſlain the</hi> Meſſias, <hi>Jeſus the Son of</hi> Mary, <hi>the Prophet and Apoſtle of God: Certainly they ſlew him not, neither crucified him; they crucified one that reſembled him: ſuch as doubt it are in a manifeſt Error; for God took him up to himſelf. Such as have the knowledge of the Scripture, ought to believe in Jeſus before his Death, he ſhall be a Witneſs againſt them in the Day of Judgment.</hi> P. 80, 81. <hi>You ſhall hear many Chriſtians that have an inclination towards true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and have Prieſts, and Religious that are humble, and their eyes full of tears, ſay, Lord we believe in thy Law, write us in the Number of them that profeſs thy Unity.</hi> P. 95. <hi>He ſhall ſay in the Day of Judgment, O Jeſus, didſt thou injoyn thy People to Worſhip Thee, and thy Mother, as two Gods: Jeſus ſhall anſwer, Praiſed be thy Name, I will take heed of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is not true; I delivered nothing but what thou commandeſt me to ſpeak,</hi> (viz.) <hi>Worſhip God your Lord, and mine,</hi> p. 99. <hi>Infidels believe not in his Unity,</hi> p. 101.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Jews <hi>ſay, That the Son of God is most just and powerful. The</hi> Chriſtians <hi>ſay, That the</hi> Meſſias <hi>is the Son of God: their words are like the words of Infidels; but God ſhall lay on them his Curſe,</hi> p. 153. <hi>Conſider how they blaſpheme, they adore their Doctors and Prieſts, and the</hi> Meſſias <hi>alſo, the Son of</hi> Mary, <hi>who commanded them to worſhip One God alone; there is but one ſole God, there is nothing equal to him: they would extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Ligqt of God, but he ſhall not ſuffer them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How the <hi>Naked Goſpel</hi> agreeth with the <hi>Alchoran</hi> in moſt of theſe particulars, might be ſhewn; but he that reads it will be ſoon ſatisfied, that it is a Commentary on that Text.</p>
               <p>But ſince the Doctor, or ſome one for him, hath written his Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, I ſhall briefly conſider what is ſaid in Defence of thoſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions condemned by the Univerſity.</p>
               <p>And firſt I obſerve, That in theſe Propoſitions, and what may be added to them from the <hi>Naked Goſpel,</hi> the quinteſſence of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Controverſies is contracted and compoſed, <hi>Secundum Artem;</hi> and by him, or ſome other on his behalf, recommended as a ſafe means to promote a General Comprehenſion, and an enlarged Charity; but to the deſtruction of Catholick Verity.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59637:12"/>
               <p>Now becauſe theſe Propoſitions are not only publiſhed in ſeveral Impreſſions of that Libel, but defended by the Author, or ſome other on his behalf; and the Gangreen begins to ſpread among prophane and unſtable Wits, which too much abound, it ſeemed neceſſary to provide an Antidote againſt thoſe old Errors, to which the Author hath given a new Reſurrection, like that which he maintains of our Bodies, not in the ſame form, but another more agreeable to his new Divinity and Philoſophy, and equally oppoſite to the written Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as underſtood by the Primitive Fathers, and received by the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The difference which the Author fancieth to be made in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is the preaching of the Doctrine of the Eternal Deity of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which this Author explodes, as not to be comprehended by his Reaſon, and not agreeable to that Natural Religion which he makes the Foundation of the Goſpel; now, if there be any alteration made, it is by thoſe which have denied the Eternal Deity of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; for as I ſaid, while St. <hi>John</hi> was yet living, <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> began that Hereſie. <hi>Ebion</hi> taught, That Chriſt was a meer Man, and had no exiſtence before he was born into the World; of which the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> then complained to St. <hi>John,</hi> deſiring him to write in Confutation of that Hereſie; and <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Ireneus</hi> brand this Hereſie, as did <hi>Ignatius</hi> before them, and St. <hi>John</hi> before him; who called ſuch as denied that Jeſus Chriſt was come in the Fleſh, Deceivers, and Antichriſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cerinthus</hi> held a pre-exiſtence of Reaſon, or the Word, which he ſays deſcended on our Saviour at his Baptiſm, and aſcended from him into Heaven, when he was crucified; for which Opinions, St. <hi>John</hi> meeting him in a Bath, fled from his company, as fearing leaſt the Walls of the Bath, wherein he was, might fall on him.</p>
               <p>Againſt theſe Hereſies St. <hi>John</hi> being importun'd, wrote his Goſpel purpoſely to aſſert the Divine Eſſence of the Son of God, as he tells us, <hi>ch.</hi> 20.31. <hi>Theſe things are written, that ye might believe, that Jeſus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing, ye might have life through his name.</hi> And beſides the Hiſtorical part of that Goſpel, the whole is one continued Argument for the Confirmation of this Truth, which we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of more at large; and ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve here what he ſays, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 5.20. <hi>We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an underſtanding, to know him that is true. This is the true God, and eternal life:</hi> And in the 2 <hi>Epiſtle, v.</hi> 7. <hi>Many deceivers are entred into the world, who confeſs not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh. This is a deceiver, and an Antichriſt.</hi> And 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 5.7. he plainly aſſerts the Doctrine of the Trinity, <hi>There are three that bear witneſs in heaven,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59637:13"/> the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and theſe Three are One.</hi> It is very obſervable what <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays in the Preface of his Annotations on St. <hi>John, The Ancients, among other cauſes of St.</hi> John<hi>'s Writing this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, do generally aſſign this as the chief, that he might apply a Remedy to that Poyſon, which at that time was diſperſed in the Church among all that profeſſed the Name of Chriſt:</hi> which could be no other, than the denying of the Eternal Deity of the Son of God, which that Evangeliſt aſſerted.</p>
               <p>Now tho' it may ſeem a ſuperfluous work to enquire into the Opinions of the Author of the <hi>Naked Goſpel,</hi> after the Cenſure of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, the reading whereof may ſatisfie any Judicious and Impartial Reader, yet leaſt I ſhould ſeem to make an Adverſary where I find none, and to fight againſt my own Shadow, as againſt ſome formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Monſter, I ſhall 1. Conſider what the Author hath ſaid to clear himſelf from the Reaſons of that Decree. 2. Make ſome few gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Remarks on the deſign of the <hi>Naked Goſpel.</hi> And 3ly, More particularly Examine the Opinions aſſerted, or inſinuated by the Author.</p>
               <p>In his Vindication, <hi>p.</hi> 4. he declares his Faith to be no other than that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and renounceth any word, which in that, or any other Book may ſeem to contradict it.</p>
               <p>The Contradiction is not ſeeming, but real, and differs as much as Time doth from Eternity; or the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> of which I have given an account from the <hi>Arrian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; if he renounceth any thing, he muſt renounce almoſt all; but how he will do it, ſo as to remove the Scandal from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which, as Monſieur <hi>Jeru</hi> obſerves, is now conceived to be tainted with <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrines, from ſuch Writings as this of the <hi>Naked Goſpel,</hi> I cannot well conceive, unleſs he diſclaim his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a true Son of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſays, The Author of that Book is ſo far from denying the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Chriſt, that he plainly aſſerts it. But what Divinity is that? is it the Eternal Godhead, and Conſubſtantiality of the Son with the Father? This is not to be found, yea, it is the whole deſign of the Author to impugne it; he grants him (no other Divinity than the <hi>Arrians</hi> did, of a created God, nor indeed ſo much; for he ſpeaks of our Saviour under the ſame Notions and Expreſſions as <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Smal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ius</hi> did, granting him a Divinity but not a Deity, of which more hereafter.</p>
               <p>But he would prove his Aſſertion from theſe words of his, <hi>That the Author of our Goſpel was not only great but infinite:</hi> But the Queſtion is, whom he means by <hi>our Author,</hi> whether God the Father the prime,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59637:13"/> or God the Son as the immediate Author; for thus the Moral Law was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet God was the prime Author; and in this ſence an <hi>Arrian</hi> may, and the <hi>Socinians</hi> do ſay Chriſt wa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the Meſſenger of God, and received all his Commands from God, and ſo the Author of the Goſpel in the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſence is infinite; for th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s <hi>Crellius</hi> on <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. v. 3. ſays, <hi>Christ was not the firſt Author of the Goſpel, as neither were the Angels of the Law, but God was the prime Author of both the Law and Goſpel, though the Law was publiſhed by Angels, and the Goſpel by Christ; ſo that Chriſt was no otherwiſe a Law-giver in publiſhing the Goſpel, than</hi> Moſes <hi>was in proclaiming the Law:</hi> which <hi>Crellius</hi> in his Book <hi>de Uno Deo</hi> endeavours to maintain at large; and in the ſame ſence I fear the Doctor calls the Author of our Goſpel infinite, <hi>viz.</hi> that God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Author of the Goſpel. But being conſcious that ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions unſuitable to ſo plain an Aſſertion as that of the Infinity of the Author of the Goſpel, might drop from his haſty Pen, he ſays p. 5. that <hi>ſuch haſty Expreſſions ought to be thereby</hi> (i. e.) by the word Infinity, <hi>to be interpreted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And ſo it might, if he had applied it to the Perſon of Chriſt, but he tells us the occaſion of that Expreſſion was, <hi>Ch.</hi> 11. from the aſſurance of a Chriſtian grounded on the Reſurrection, beyond the hopes of a Heathen, and the Perſons in whom the one and the other believed: Now whom do the <hi>Arrians</hi> believe to be the Author of that Reſurrection, but God the Father, whom they often affirm to have raiſed our Saviour from the Dead; and its no wonder if they own his Infinity, this being the ſubſtance of what they ſay is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be believed, viz. <hi>That God raiſed Jeſus from the Dead, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs him our Lord;</hi> denying that Chriſt aroſe by any power of his own.</p>
               <p>Therefore he would not have his Expreſſions imputed to his ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Opinion, but his too great haſt and heat in a Queſtion which did nor concern the <hi>Divinity of Christ,</hi> but the <hi>manner of his Generation;</hi> the former (as he adds) was on both ſides acknowledged, the latter was the whole ſubject of the Diſpute, which <hi>Conſtantine</hi>s Letter ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten calleth Silly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the Divinity of Chriſt in its proper ſence, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, had been acknowlegded, I believe there had been no diſpute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the manner of his Generation; the Queſtion was, Whether he were Conſubſtantial with the Father or not; not concerning the manner or <hi>modus,</hi> but whether he were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of the ſame Subſtance with the Father?</p>
               <p>If the Diſpute in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time had been only about the manner of Chriſt's Generation, the Doctor might have taken in the Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59637:14"/> of Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> (that it is not diſtinctly declared by God, nor are we able fully to comprehend it, nor is it neceſſary for us to know) but it is neceſſary to know that this Generation was from Eternity, that we may ground our Faith and Hope in him that is God, and ſo is able to ſave to the utmoſt all that come to God by him, he being the Lord, <hi>(i. e.) Jehovah</hi>) our Righteouſneſs. What the Controverſy in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council againſt <hi>Arrius</hi> was, and how it was decided, ſhall appear anon.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly, He ſays, the deſign of his Book was <hi>only to diſable Humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from impoſing on our Belief more Doctrines than Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles declared to be neceſſary.</hi> Here are two bold Strokes; firſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor will determine what thoſe neceſſary Doctrines are, and then he will diſable Magiſtrates from impoſing any other; and ſo we ſhall loſe the great Fundamental, the Eternal Godhead of Chriſt, which his <hi>Naked Goſpel</hi> doth impugne.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly, Another deſign of this Author, <hi>he</hi> ſays is, <hi>By a due confinement of Faith to enlarge Charity. Anſ.</hi> The Apoſtles method to enlarge Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, was not to confine, but propagate the Faith once delivered to the Saints, as the beſt motive to Charity, <hi>we have one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm,</hi> but (ſuch as the Author is) the <hi>Socinians,</hi> deny the Lord that bought them, deſtroy the Foundation of Faith in the Godhead, and ſatisfaction of Chriſt, and wholly diſannul Baptiſm, and ſo cut aſunder this triple Cord that obligeth Chriſtians to Charity; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as they acknowledge not the one Lord, ſo they nullify the one Faith in him, and make the one Baptiſm of no effect, and therefore have utterly deſtroyed Charity.</p>
               <p>The next charge of expoſing the Divinity of Chriſt, he ſays <hi>p.</hi> 5. hath no other evidence but this, <hi>That he is ſometimes ſtiled a crucified Vagabond;</hi> and this he ſays is but once, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Introduction.</hi> But was it not ſaid with as little modeſty, <hi>p.</hi> 21. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>That he was a Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond</hi> Galilean; which expreſſions by the Rule of <hi>Fortiter calumniare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquod adherebit,</hi> will not excuſe him, by ſaying he perſonated an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del; ſuch playing with Holy Things, is much worſe than his play at puſh Pin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 6. he proteſteth, <hi>That in his whole life he never ſpent ſo much time in reading</hi> Socinian <hi>Books, as put altogether would amount to one whole day.</hi> By ſpending ſo much time, I ſuppoſe he means he did not loſe or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend it, but it was well beſtowed; or perhaps he made the <hi>Arrian</hi> Controverſy his chief Study, which is as contrary to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the <hi>Socinian.</hi> So <hi>Socinus</hi> proteſted he never read <hi>Arrius, Credat. Judaeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:59637:14"/>
               <p>I would here remind the Doctor of the excellent Advice of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, mentioned by himſelf, in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, <hi>I would have you, as I hope you are already, well grounded and ſetled in your Religion, the beſt Profeſſion whereof I have ever eſteemed that of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>in which you have been Educated,</hi> &amp;c. It is well known that the Doctor was not only educated in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but to that very time when he wrote his <hi>Naked Goſpel,</hi> that is till he was ſixty five Years old, as he computes his Age, he hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Communion of that Church; we may therefore marvel, how he was ſo ſoon removed from him that called him to the Grace of Chriſt, unto another Goſpel (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6.) which would pervert the Goſpel of Chriſt: Did he not judiciouſly make the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> his own, as that Bleſſed King adviſed? Did he not by his own judgment and reaſon, but by his hand only ſeal to the Bond which Education had written, or take it up only on Mens Cuſtoms or Traditions, as that good King ſpeaks; if ſo, he was guilty of great Oſcitancy in the matter of Religion, on which Salvation depends; or if after ſo long Profeſſion of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church, he began to entertain ſome doubts of the truth of it, he was guilty of great Levity in ſo weighty a Matter, not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow many Years in the Examination of the Errors of that Doctrine which he forſook, and imbracing another vaſtly and dangerouſly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from it, without beſtowing ſo much as one Day's reading the Grounds and Reaſons of it. On ſuppoſition therefore, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor hath embraced either the <hi>Arrian</hi> or <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrines, he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountably raſh (there being ſo many Books written by learned Men of both Parties) to leave a Religion which he had ſo long profeſt, and had time to enquire into, and without more than one Days ſtudy, in a Caſe of ſuch conſequence, to fall off to a contrary Opinion. This may tempt Men to think it was done in a Pet; ſome may think, becauſe he was not removed to a higher Station, as he intimates, ſomewhere, the Archbiſhop promiſed he ſhould in ſome ſhort time, but being not done, he thought to remind him of his Promiſe by Dedicating that Book of a <hi>Conſtant Communicant</hi> to his Grace; yet after all he was left in that Place where he ſpent three Pence of his own to every Penny of his Preferment: For my part I have a better opinion of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and that he had long ſtudied, and often diſcourſed with learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men concerning the <hi>Socinian</hi> Controverſy, and that the <hi>Naked Goſpel</hi> was the product of many Years ſpent in Reading, Conference and Meditation on thoſe Points, before he came to a Reſolution. For I have heard of a Doctor of his Age, who often diſcourſed with his Father, a Reverend Divine, concerning ſome <hi>Arminian, Pelagian,</hi> and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59637:15"/> 
                  <hi>Socinian</hi> Points, and in heat of diſputation did tell his Father, That it would not be well till we came up to the <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrine; this was many years ſince. And what means his ſitting down when the <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſian</hi> Creed was ſaid, but his contempt of it.</p>
               <p>The next Charge is, <hi>That the Godhead of our Saviour is declared to be an impertinent and dangerous Speculation.</hi> This he thinks is diſcharged by the former diſtinction, of the manner of the Generation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and adds, <hi>That thoſe Fathers who were the most earnest Aſſertors of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ's Divinity,</hi> (he doth not ſay of his Eternal Deity) <hi>were alſo the moſt ſevere Cenſurers of Curioſity concerning the manner of his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> And our Author is a Son of thoſe Fathers, who granted a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Deity to our Saviour, and moſt ſeverely cenſured thoſe that held his Eternal Generation, as being guilty of Polytheiſm, which is often intimated by him. This is the ſum of the Author's Defence.</p>
               <p>I would willingly know of what ſort of Divinity it is, that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to our Saviour, becauſe I find that the <hi>Arrians</hi> acknowledge, that he is a Created God; and the <hi>Socinians</hi> grant a Divinity, but not ſo much as a Created Deity. I ſee no more granted him, as to his Perſon, by the <hi>Socinians</hi> than by the <hi>Turks,</hi> which acknowledge he was a Divine Man, and a true Prophet, or Meſſenger of God: This Divinity he learnt of <hi>Smalcius,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew hereafter, or of <hi>Crellius,</hi> as is already ſhewn, whoſe words as well as ſence he ſo often repeats, as will give great cauſe to the Reader to conclude, that he ſpent more than one whole Day in reading the <hi>Socinian</hi> Controverſies.</p>
               <p>The general Remarks which I ſhall make on the <hi>Naked Goſpel,</hi> are as follow:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That whereas the Author pretends the ſpecial Deſign of it is to enlarge Charity, yet that Charity is only deſigned for a Toleration of the <hi>Arrian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrines, and he ſharply reflects on all ſuch as he perceived to be averſe from ſuch his enlarged Charity, <hi>p.</hi> 39. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. <hi>If Biſhop</hi> Alexander <hi>the firſt Author of the Nicety, thought fit to tolerate the</hi> Arrians, <hi>we can ill prentend to Charity if we allow them no title to God's Pardon, or his Church's Communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 57. of his interpolated Edition, he pleads, <hi>That nothing can be more odious than to perſecute as Hereticks and Malefactors, all ſuch as ſhould refuſe to be impoſed on,</hi> viz. <hi>by the Biſhops that aſſerted the Trinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 11. of his <hi>Vindication,</hi> he recommends the charitable Hereſie of the Latitudinarians, under which term he may comprehend all ſort of Hereſies, an univerſal Toleration without any reſerve, which hath been pleaded for in former times.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That through the whole Book it is not ſo much the manner of the Generation that is inſiſted on, but the Eternity of it is denied, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59637:15"/> to this end the Arguments of the <hi>Arrians</hi> are applauded, and the Reaſons and Scriptures that affirm it, are either ſuppreſſed, or ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul'd.</p>
               <p>To begin with the Propoſitions referred to in the Decree, he tells us, <hi>That</hi> Mahomet <hi>did profeſs all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith:</hi> but <hi>Mahomet</hi> did not profeſs the Eternal Generation of the Son of God; therefore this is no Article of the Chriſtian Faith, in the Doctor's Opinion.</p>
               <p>What the Charity of the <hi>Socinians</hi> is, toward ſuch as hold the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> we may learn from <hi>Smalcius,</hi> at the end of his Book, concerning the Divinity of Chriſt: <hi>We doubt not to affirm boldly, that not one of all thoſe who believe Jeſus Christ of himſelf God, can ever by any means have certain hope of Eternal Life, by vertue of his Opinion concerning Chriſt. Hence they call us,</hi> Polytheiſts, Antichriſtians; and ſay, <hi>we are not worthy of the Name of Chriſtians.</hi> This is Charity enlarged.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Paragraph he ſays, <hi>When by nice and hot Diſputes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, eſpecially the Second and Third Perſons of the Trinity, the Minds of the People had been long confounded, ſo that, to vulgar underſtandings, the Doctrine of the Trinity appeared no leſs guilty of Polytheiſm, than that of Image-worſhip did of Idolatry; then was there a tempting opportunity offered to the Impoſtor, and he laid hold on it to ſet up himſelf for a reformer of ſuch corruptions as were both too groſs to be juſtified, and too viſible to be denied.</hi> Now what did this Impoſtor reform, but the Doctrine of the Trinity, denying the Godhead of the Son and Holy Ghoſt, as ſuch corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which were too groſs to be juſtified, and too viſible to be denied. It is a credible Hiſtory of thoſe Times, which I have related, that one <hi>Sergius</hi> a Monk, and ſome other Apoſtate Chriſtians, join'd with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> in compiling the <hi>Alchoran;</hi> theſe retained ſo much venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our Saviour as to grant him what the <hi>Socinians</hi> do, a kind of Divinity; for they acknowledge him to be a true Prophet, and ſo he may be called Divine, as we call St. <hi>John,</hi> by way of Eminency, <hi>The Divine:</hi> and ſo our <hi>Socinian</hi> Reformers agree with the <hi>Mahometan,</hi> ſome ſay the Doctrine of the Trinity was laid aſide to make way for the Turks to become Chriſtians; but we find a contrary effect, that many Chriſtians turn Turks.</p>
               <p>I hope the Reader is ſatisfied, by what I collected out of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choran,</hi> that <hi>Mahomet</hi> and his <hi>Arian</hi> Genius purpoſely deſigned to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Doctrine of the Trinity, and to repreſent our Saviour as a meer Man, though as a Meſſenger of God. And what leſs is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe words of the Doctor's, <hi>That to vulgar underſtandings the Doctrine of the Trinity appeared no leſs guilty of Polytheiſm, than that of Image-worſhip did of Idolatry?</hi>

               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59637:16"/>
               <p>The next Propoſition is This, <hi>When the great Queſtion concerning the eternity of his</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Chriſt's Godhead first embroiled the World,</hi> Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine <hi>condemned it as a ſilly Queſtion, fitter for Fools and Children, than for Prieſts or wiſe Men.</hi> Note here; The Queſtion was not concerning the Manner of <hi>the Generation of our Saviour,</hi> but the Eternity of his Godhead, and how juſtly this Cenſure of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s was paſt on that Queſtion, this Author ſays, we may diſcover in three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. 1. <hi>It was impertinent to our Lord's Deſign.</hi> 2. <hi>Fruitleſs to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templator's own purpoſe.</hi> 3. <hi>It is dangerous.</hi> This is Socinianiſm in grain.</p>
               <p>Now, becauſe the Author would excuſe himſelf from this Charge, by pleading, that he only relates the Opinion of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the conſideration of that good Emperor's management and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this great Queſtion, is more ſtrictly and fully to be weighed. This Author tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 31. Col. 2. <hi>Such was the judgment of the great</hi> Conſtantine, <hi>when the Game was firſt ſet on foot.</hi> How it was then by the <hi>Arian</hi> party repreſented to him, is not evident: they dealt ſubtily, but after that, he had called the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and was fully informed of the ſtate of the Queſtion; he was ſo far from thinking it ſilly and vain, that he wrote Letters to ſeveral Churches to inform them, that after mature conſideration, the Opinion of <hi>Arius</hi> was condemned, branded the <hi>Arians</hi> with the Name of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrians,</hi> cauſed their Books to be burnt, and threatned death to any that ſhould conceal them; and hearing of the miſerable end of that wretched man, as it is deſcribed by <hi>Socrates,</hi> he made it his buſineſs to extirpate it. No doubt the Doctor knew theſe paſſages related of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> as well as thoſe which he mentions, calling it a Silly Queſtion, and fitter for Boys than for Prieſts; what can he plead then for proclaiming the one, and wholly ſuppreſſing the other, which were <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s ſecond and beſt Thoughts, and his ſetled Judgment after mature deliberation?</p>
               <p>Yet our Author ſtill ridicules the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Doctrine, as a <hi>Puſhpin Controverſie,</hi> and ſays, <hi>that</hi> Leonas <hi>reprimanded that party, with, Go and play the Fools at home.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonas</hi> was an <hi>Arian,</hi> ſent by <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the <hi>Arian</hi> Emperour, to awe the Council; nor did he bid them go and play the Fools at home, I find no ſuch thing in the place quoted by the Doctor, <hi>viz. Socrates, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 23. But there is a full Character of this <hi>Leonas,</hi> in <hi>Soz. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 22. how that <hi>Acacius</hi> an <hi>Arian</hi> Biſhop, held private Conference with him, and conſulted for that Intereſt, but could not prevail; inſomuch, that when both Parties were met in his Lodgings, and he found the <hi>Arian</hi> Party like to be baffled, he bid them in theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; which I think no good Man would tranſlate, Go and play the Fools at home, <hi>Socrates</hi> l. 2. <hi>c.</hi> 40. which ſignifies only, <hi>Go and talk it out in the Church. Leonas</hi> ſuppoſing they would be more modeſt and reverent in that Holy Place, than in his Houſe. But of this the Hiſtorian obſerves in the next <hi>chap.</hi> 42, That <hi>Acacius</hi> and <hi>Eudoxius</hi> made great advantage; For (ſays he) they perceiving the Indignation of the Emperour againſt <hi>Macedonius,</hi> and other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, depoſed many of them, and advanced <hi>Eudoxius</hi> to the Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> for the contention was not ſo much for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as for Preferment; the contending Parties having depoſed each other, and <hi>Acacius</hi> and <hi>Eudoxius</hi> with their Party did eſpecially endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to depoſe the adverſe Party, and coined their New Creeds to that end, being ſo confident of the Emperour's Favour; and hence grew thoſe various Confeſſions of ſome Councils under <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> whereof, <hi>p.</hi> 34. <hi>c.</hi> 4. the Doctor ſays, <hi>That</hi> Socrates <hi>reckoned no leſs than Nine,</hi> (not Nine Councils, but Confeſſions; of which the Hiſtorian gives this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Account, (calling them a Labyrinth of Expoſitions) <hi>two of which were ſet forth at</hi> Antioch; <hi>a third by</hi> Narciſſus, <hi>and ſome Biſhops with him; the fourth by</hi> Eudoxius; <hi>three others at</hi> Sirmium, <hi>one of which was read at</hi> Ariminum; <hi>the eighth was that of</hi> Acacius, <hi>publiſhed at</hi> Selucia, <hi>which was the ſame that was publiſhed at</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>with an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix, forbidding the uſe of the words Subſtance and Hypoſtaſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now all theſe were conceived and brought forth in a few Years together, under <hi>Conſtantius;</hi> and by the influence of that <hi>Arian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, who made it his buſineſs to advance and propagate that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie: But what are theſe ſcuffles for Intereſt and Promotion, (which though favoured by an <hi>Arian</hi> Emperour, were not only ſtrenuouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but generally defeated) to the conſtant and unanimous Decrees of the four firſt General Councils, and many others of the Eaſtern Churches, and by all the Weſtern or Latin Churches, who conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted the Doctrine of the Trinity.</p>
               <p>I cannot better compare theſe Alterations in Matters of Faith, which were made after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, than to the various Revolutions that hapned in this Kingdom, after the Dethroning of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. of bleſſed Memory; wherein the ſeveral Factions, as they got into Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſtrove not ſo much for Religion, (which was always made the pretence) as for Intereſt and Advantage, to the overthrow both of a well-eſtabliſh'd Government and Religion, which now, through the Bleſſing of God, are returned to their ancient Channels; and may they ever bear down all oppoſition, and run on without interruption to make glad the City of God.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59637:17"/>
               <p>I cannot omit one Remark more in this place, namely, how par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial the Doctor is in relating the Hiſtory of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and <hi>Arius.</hi> He ſumms up in few words, whatever <hi>Philoſtorgus</hi> and <hi>Sandius</hi> the <hi>Arians</hi> had ſuggeſted againſt <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> How he was baniſhed by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Tyre, Antioch, Sirmium</hi> and <hi>Ariminum;</hi> but is aſhamed to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thoſe Sham-Plots that were contrived againſt him, and retorted upon his adverſaries, to their perpetual Infamy, as Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> have diſcovered; nor have we a word how at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Millan,</hi> where the Catholicks were forced to condemn <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius, Conſtantius</hi> drawing his Sword, and telling them, <hi>That he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf accuſed</hi> Athanaſius, and ought to be believed, and baniſhed ſuch as would not conſent to it. But as for <hi>Arius</hi> he pleads for him, as if he had been as much a Meſſenger ſent from God as our Saviour in his opinion was; as much doth he ſpeak in defence of <hi>Arius.</hi> That he was juſtified by ſuch as had condemned him by the Emperor, and a Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> p. 37. c. 2. And <hi>Athaſius</hi> threatned to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, if he did not receive him into communion, though the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor confeſſeth he would not admit the word <hi>Conſubſtantial</hi> into his Creed. That the Eaſtern Biſhops (but ſuch as the Doctor ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 38. <hi>c.</hi> 2.) were generally <hi>Arians,</hi> took <hi>Arius</hi> his part againſt <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and condemn'd him in the Council of <hi>Sardica.</hi> But all this trouble was not occaſioned upon the account of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Faith, but the <hi>Arian</hi> perfidy, who falſly accuſed and maliciouſly condemned him. Wherefore it will be ſeaſonable in this place to give you a ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what the moſt Authentick Hiſtorians have related; which you ſhall have preſently.</p>
               <p>In the third Propoſition, he ſays, <hi>That the Evangeliſts in ſetting down our Lord's Genealogy, do not ſatisfie, but amuſe us; and profeſſing to inſtruct us, do doubly diſappoint us: firſt by deriving it from a wrong Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then by deſtracting us two ſeveral ways; which,</hi> he ſays, <hi>is a warning againſt ſearching after the Eternal Generation.</hi> As ſuppoſing it to be needleſs, and therefore impoſſible to prove him derived from <hi>David,</hi> (though the Scripture calls him both <hi>David</hi>'s Son, and <hi>David</hi>'s Lord) he concludes it to be impoſſible to underſtand his Eternal Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. And thus the knowledge both of the Generation of our Saviour as Man, as well as that as God, are both concluded to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be known, becauſe they are above our Underſtandings. So that he firſt raiſeth a doubt of our Saviour's Deſcent from <hi>David,</hi> according to the Fleſh, that he may make that a ground of his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Generation by the Father.</p>
               <p>In the fourth Propoſition he intimates, <hi>That a Heathen might juſtifie</hi> Polytheiſm, <hi>at the ſame rate as the</hi> Athanaſian <hi>Fathers have done the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59637:17"/> of the Trinity; and that the</hi> Papiſts <hi>may juſtifie their no-leſs-beloved Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of</hi> Tranſubſtantiation (as he calls it): and affirms, with them, <hi>That the Scripture is no leſs expreſs for the one, than the other; and the Contradictions no leſs groſs in the one, than the other.</hi> And then ridicules that learned and ingenuous Tract, which was lately Printed, to ſhew what better grounds the Doctrine of the Trinity hath in the Scripture, than that of Tranſubſtantiation, for want of Argument to confute it: As if we could as eaſily apprehend the Nature of Things immaterial, and removed above our Reaſon, as well as our Sence, as we can of thoſe corporeal Beings, ſuch as the conſecrated Hoſts, which contradict both Reaſon and Sence.</p>
               <p>In the Fifth Propoſition he affirms, <hi>That the Queſtions concerning the Trinity were decided by no other Evidence, but of Imperial and Papal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Pope would be much more obliged and grateful to him, than the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if he could prove the Supremacy of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> over all the Churches, and that in Matters of Faith, as ancient as <hi>Conſtantine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Sixth, <hi>That there is danger of Blaſphemy, in examining the ſilly Queſtion, concerning the Eternity of the Godhead of Christ; and that we have no firm ground to go upon.</hi> But is not that Rule of <hi>Vincent Liri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis,</hi> a good ground, <hi>Quod ſemper quod ubi<expan>

               <p>In the Seventh, <hi>That the only advantage of the Catholicks, is long poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion: That they have ſo handled matters, as to hide much, and varniſh all. That the Sentence which determined the Controverſie in the Council of</hi> Nice, <hi>was not by the Merit of the Cauſe, but the Intereſt of Parties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Long poſſeſſion of ſuch Truths as have a good Foundation in the Scripture, is a Title beyond any that pretends againſt it; when the Univerſal Church hath in all Ages, (except only a ſhort interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, under one or two <hi>Arian</hi> Princes) judged the Doctrine againſt the Deity of our Saviour, as a deſtructive Heroſie: If we may thank the Doctor for any thing, it is for granting us this long poſſeſſion, even ever ſince the Goſpel was firſt publiſhed.</p>
               <p>In the Eighth Propoſition he ſays, <hi>This long and miſchievous Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie was at laſt decided by</hi> Theodoſius; <hi>who receiving his Inſtructions and Baptiſm from a Conſubſtantialist, required all his Subjects to conform to that Religion, which</hi> Peter, <hi>the Prince of the Apoſtles, from the beginning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the</hi> Romans; <hi>and which at that time</hi> Damaſus <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and</hi> Peter <hi>of</hi> Alexandria <hi>held: and that Church only ſhould be eſteemed Catholick, which worſhipped the Divine Trinity with equal Honour: and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59637:18"/> thoſe which held the contrary, ſhould be called Hereticks, made infamous, and puniſhed.</hi> (All this <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> had done long before.) He adds, <hi>Behold now the ground on which one of our Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Articles of Faith is built.</hi> The meaning of this is, that it is an Imperial Impoſition; to which we ſhall give an Anſwer anon.</p>
               <p>Prop. 9. <hi>What more ridiculouſly ſilly, than to build ſo weighty a Doctrine upon implicite Faith in two Biſhops, partial to their own Sees, whereof the one gave it Birth, the other Maintenance; and what more odious, than to proſecute as Hereticks and Malefactors, all ſuch as ſhould refuſe to be ſo groſly impoſed on?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What can be more falſly ſaid, than that this Doctrine hath no other Foundation than what this Author allows it? When it was confirm'd by that famous Council, not as their own Opinions only, but as the conſtant Doctrine of the <hi>Churches of God</hi> in former Ages, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Holy Scriptures; and therefore to reflect on it, as the firſt and moſt uncharitable Diſpute that ever rent the Chriſtian World, doth not become any Chriſtian, much leſs a true Son of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> See <hi>p.</hi> 55. <hi>col.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>In the 10th Propoſition he affirms, <hi>That</hi> (on his Premiſes being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered) <hi>Men may be tempted</hi> (as it ſeems he hath been) <hi>to number the</hi> Athanaſian, <hi>among the</hi> Roman <hi>Doctrines, and to leave it on the ſame level with the</hi> Arrian, <hi>equally unworthy of our Faith and Study.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It appears then, that our Doctor never ſtudied this Doctrine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he hath long been a Profeſſor, ſo far, as to make it an Article of his Faith; and if his <hi>Pelagian</hi> Doctrines and Sermons concerning Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin; for which many learned Men have ſeverely cenſured him; with which the Univerſity was ſo offended, as to oblige him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, by way of a Recantation; and of his Opinion of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Devotion, and his <hi>Naked Goſpel,</hi> were duly conſidered, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderator muſt be perſwaded, that the Doctor had made the <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrines his conſtant ſtudy, and never thought the Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines worthy of his Study or Faith; or that inſtead of not beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one days ſtudy in reading <hi>Socinian</hi> Writers, he had not beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much time in reading the Articles or Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 11th he ſaith, <hi>We cannot think it neceſſary to Salvation, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very private Chriſtian,</hi> (and by the ſame reaſon, that no private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian) <hi>ſhould believe that as an Article of Faith, which the beſt Ages of the Church thought not worth knowing.</hi> Which in the Second Edition he thus expreſſeth: <hi>An Opinion which ſo many good and wiſe Men as lived within three hundred years after Chriſt, were ſo far from believing as matter of Faith, that they did not receive it as matter of certainty, nor perhaps of credibility.</hi>

               <p>That learned and ſeaſonable Collection of Mr. <hi>Bull</hi>'s, concerning the Judgment of the Fathers in the firſt 300 Years after our Saviour, ſhews abundantly, what was their belief concerning the Deity of our Saviour, which may ſilence the Diſpute, and ſave the labour of any farther Collection; an account whereof, for my Country-mens ſake, who either underſtand not the Latin Tongue, or cannot compaſs the Book, I ſhall preſent to my Reader, and refer the Learned to the Book itſelf, where they may find all their Teſtimonies vindicated, and irrefragably aſſerted, againſt the Objection of <hi>Sandius, Petavius,</hi> and other <hi>Socinian</hi> Authors, in their proper place.</p>
               <p>In the Twelfth Propoſition he inſinuates, <hi>That the Poſitions of the</hi> Athanaſians <hi>ſeems to infer Polytheiſm:</hi> and when they deny the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, he ſays, <hi>They contradict the Rules of Reaſoning; and that they do ſo, becauſe they allow Reaſon no hearing in Myſteries of Faith; and that this cannot excuſe them from being Hereticks in Religion or Logick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas for the <hi>Arrians</hi> he pleads, <hi>That they profeſs to believe of Christ whatever himſelf or his Apoſtles have ſpoken, and where-ever one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion ſeems to contradict another, they take ſuch a courſe to reconcile them, as the Laws and Cuſtoms of all the World direct.</hi> This ſhews plainly what Party he adheres to.</p>
               <p>The Rule which he gives us for the juſtification of the <hi>Arians</hi> is this: <hi>It is frequent for Rhetorick to exceed, but never to diminiſh the Grammatical Character of a Perſon, whoſe Honour the Writer profeſſeth to advance; and therefore they think it more reaſonable, that thoſe expreſſions which exalt our Saviour's Perſon to an equality wth the Father, ſhould ſtoop to thoſe which ſpeak him inferiour; rather than thoſe which ſpeak him inferiour, ſhould be ſtrained up to thoſe which ſpeak him equal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if Chriſt and his Apoſtles, which wrote the Hiſtory of Chriſt, did not deal more faithfully in relating the truth concerning his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as being one and equal to the Father; than thoſe Rhetoricians, who to advance the Doctrine of <hi>Arius,</hi> would depreſs him beneath himſelf, and leave him as Naked as the <hi>New Goſpel</hi> doth, ſtripping him
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59637:19"/> of all thoſe glorious Attributes that ſhould ſupport his Worſhip, and depriving the Church of that ſatisfaction which he made for it, when he redeemed it with his own moſt precious Blood; which by the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> Doctor's is trampled under foot, and counted a vain thing. Theſe Propoſitions will fall under our farther Conſideration, of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Chapters: To which I now proceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. He treats of the Goſpel preached by our Saviour and his Apoſtles, as neceſſary to Salvation; the Character whereof, is either that of a Covenant, or a Meſſage. Of the Goſpel as a Covenant, he ſpeaks as ſlightly as ſhort, quoting only <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8. and ſays, <hi>It is delivered more ſuccinctly,</hi> ch. 10.17. This Covenant he ſays, <hi>Leans on the Law of Nature, which alſo keeps it firm in its place.</hi> Thus the Covenant of Grace is confounded with the Law of Works, though the Apoſtle ſets them in oppoſition: <hi>We are not under the Law, but Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Chriſt is the Foundation of the Evangelical Covenant, ratified and ſealed by his Blood, the Scripture teacheth ſo plainly, that he that runs may read, Covenants were wont to be made by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, as Dr. <hi>Outrede</hi> hath proved; and ſo was this Covenant, it was ſealed in the Blood of the Son of God, without which there could be no remiſſion. The Apoſtle calls him, the Surety of a better Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and bringing in a better hope: the firſt Covenant was, <hi>Do this, and live:</hi> the ſecond is, <hi>He that believes, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved:</hi> And this Covenant, <hi>Dat quod Jubet,</hi> it aſſiſts us in willing and doing what is required, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. 'Tis a better Covenant, eſtabliſhed on better Promiſes. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. This is my Covenant, I will put my Law into their hearts, and write them in their minds; and I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a People: and I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins and iniquities will I remember no more.</p>
               <p>But he commends eſpecially the Character of the Goſpel as a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and ſo makes our Saviour only an eminent Prophet, that came to advance the Natural Religion a little higher than other Prophets had done; his deſign being no other than to advance Natural Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a higher perfection, by nobler Precepts and richer Promiſes, as he ſays. This is no more than what the Turks will grant in Honour of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>But there is another Notion of the Goſpel more common than the other two, though purpoſely omitted by the Doctor; which is, as we render it, the New Teſtament of our Saviour, who was not only (as <hi>Socinus</hi> ſaith) a Witneſs of that Teſtament, but the Teſtator himſelf; that Teſtament whereby Chriſt makes us Heirs of all that he hath
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59637:19"/> purchaſed for us; that Teſtament which was ſealed by his Blood, and took effect by his Death and Reſurrection for the Salvation of all that believe in him, and obey his Commandments; <hi>Grotius</hi> on the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, makes it parallel with the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which he ſays is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſignifying to kill or cut down.</p>
               <p>But as he obſerves, the Goſpel is not called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Covenant, in a ſtrict ſence, wherein two Parties do mutually Covenant, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the Will or Teſtament of a Superiour, who adds Rewards to the performance of his Will; and it is called, the New Teſtament, being a Covenant of Grace, not of Debt upon our Works, but Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon our Faith: So that <hi>Grotius</hi> concludes, the moſt proper Notion of the Goſpel, is that of a Teſtament, by which the Heir is obliged under certain Conditions, and by way of a Truſt repoſed in him; and he defines it to be the Will of Chriſt confirmed to us by his Death, whereby we have a Right to all his Promiſes, on performance of his Commandments.</p>
               <p>But the Doctor carefully avoids any word that might imply the Doctrine of Chriſt's Satisfaction, and therefore as he wholly ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that of a Teſtament, which hath its effect from the Death of the Teſtator, (as our Saviour often calls it, the New Teſtament in his Blood, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25.) ſo he ſlights that of a Covenant, as being wont to be confirmed by the Death of the Sacrifice (for in all Languages, <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> as well as in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to ſtrike a Covenant, imported the Sanction of it, by ſhedding of Blood) and prefers the Notion of a <hi>Meſſage,</hi> as if Chriſt had done no more for us than <hi>Moſes,</hi> or any of the Prophets, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> only declared the Precepts of God, which is pure <hi>Socinianiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. he ſays, <hi>The deſign of the Goſpel is no other, than the advancement of Primitive Natural Religion to a higher perfection:</hi> for which he alledgeth thoſe words of St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.3. <hi>Theſe things we write unto you, that you may have fellowſhip with us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Patriarchs knew only the Father, but our Fellowſhip is with the Father and the Son; as therefore in the face of Jeſus Christ we ſee more of the Father's goodneſs, ſo are we thereby obliged to higher ſtrains of love to him, and one another, which is the ſum of Natural Religion.</hi> And again, <hi>p.</hi> 2. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. <hi>The deſign of the Goſpel is to exalt us to the highest perfection of the Natural Law, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us perfect, as our Father which is in heaven is perfect: This is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick General Test,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>whereby every Doctrine muſt be tried, that claimeth our entertainment as a Goſpel truth.</hi> And thus he equalleth Moral Vertue with Criſtian Faith, and teacheth <hi>Pelagianiſm;</hi> which makes the ſtrength of Natural Endeavours ſufficient to Salvation, without the ſpecial Grace of Chriſt, as if that were not neceſſary to humble us
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59637:20"/> in the ſenſe of our Sins, to mortifie our Luſts, inlighten our Minds, ſubdue our perverſe Wills, and purifie our Hearts; they may be good Moral Men that conform to the Rules of Reaſon, but no good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, unleſs they are aſſiſted by the Grace of the Holy Spirit; they may have a form of Godlineſs, but not the power thereof.</p>
               <p>He greatly extols Natural Religion, affirming, <hi>That the Faith which the Goſpel requires, had its Foundation in Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Natural Faith,</hi> as he ſays, <hi>is propoſed as the Mother of Evangelical, p.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 14. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi>I have proved,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that Faith in God is a Duty of Natural Religion, a Moral Vertue, a participation of the Divine Nature in one of God's Attributes, his Juſtice to be valued as ſelf-good,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>P.</hi> 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. He makes <hi>the Law of Nature the Foundation on which the New Covenant ſo leaneth, as to be kept firm in its place.</hi> I fear that the Reaſon of his thus extolling Natural Religion, is, becauſe that in its higheſt perfection it can attain only to the knowledge of the Unity of the Godhead, (though in the depraved State of Nature, Men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally worſhipped many Falſe, inſtead of the One true God) but this Natural Religion ſuits better with the deſign of <hi>Arius,</hi> than of the Goſpel, and therefore the Author eſpouſeth and magnifies it.</p>
               <p>He adds, <hi>That as</hi> Abraham <hi>is propoſed as the Father of the faithful, Natural Faith is alſo propoſed as the Mother of Evangelical.</hi> Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt enquire, whether the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> were meerly a Natural Faith, and he had no Revelations that begat and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Faith.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arians</hi> grant, that as our Saviour ſays, <hi>Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was I am, that Christ was before the Creation of the World, the Lamb ſlain from the beginning, that by him the World was made;</hi> yet the Doctor decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his opinion, that the Patriarchs had the knowledge of God the Father only, but it is like that of <hi>Abailardus,</hi> contrary to the opinion of all other Doctors of the Church, and the tenor of the Scriptures; for how then is it ſaid, that <hi>Abraham</hi> rejoyced to ſee my day, and ſaw it, the day of his Incarnation in <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s wonderful Conception, his Death and Reſurrection in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s readineſs to ſacrifice him, and God's delivering him from death, from whence <hi>Abraham</hi> received him in a Figure or Type of Chriſt, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> thus expounds that place, <hi>That as Chriſt being a man was after</hi> Abraham, <hi>ſo as God he was before</hi> Abraham, <hi>and as being a man he was the ſon of</hi> David, <hi>but as God he was</hi> David<hi>'s Lord, as man he was born into the world, as God he made the world.</hi> Tertul. de Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitat.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:59637:20"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 9. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. He takes occaſion to mention the two great Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of our Saviour, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm, and the Sacrament of his Body and Blood; theſe he calls <hi>Poſitive Rites, which he,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Chriſt, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thereby to ingage us to profeſs our ſelves his Diſciples, and are not Parts of his Covenant, but Badges of his Followers, and Acknowledgments of our Homage to his Perſon.</hi> Theſe Rituals, ſays he, <hi>we ſhall not neglect:</hi> yet I find not one word of the Euchariſt; all that he ſays of Baptiſm is, <hi>Pag.</hi> 22. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Deſign of Baptiſm, as he had ſaid before, was an open Profeſſion of Faith, in defiance to the World and all its Powers,</hi> forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what he had ſaid before, on our Saviour's words, and Commiſſion to his Diſciples, whom he ſent to baptize, <hi>He that believeth and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized ſhall be ſaved,</hi> not ſimply as he notes, he that believeth, <hi>but he that believeth and is baptized,</hi> and as the Apoſtle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. reckoneth Baptiſm among the Fundamentals, ſo it hath the Characters which our Author requires in a Fundamental, <hi>viz.</hi> a Precept with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe annexed, <hi>ſhall be ſaved,</hi> yet he thinks it but a Ceremony and Badge of outward profeſſion.</p>
               <p>I cannot but take notice how the Doctor pretending to be an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> turns Prevaricator, and inſtead of giving them a right to it, robs them of the benefits thereof; he ſays indeed, <hi>that the Church may upon ſmall ſecurity from other ſureties admit any Infant for a Member,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>of ſuch a Society as do profeſs the Faith of Christ;</hi> and by his argument they may (as well omit as) admit the Baptiſm of Children; <hi>for,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſince the Goſpel is the eſtabliſhed Religion, and the Profeſſion of the very Parents maketh great odds against any danger of the contrary, the Church may,</hi> &amp;c. So that the Profeſſion of the Parents may ſuperſede the ſmall ſecurity of other Sureties, and if there be no other end of Baptiſm but to ingage Infants to the Profeſſion of Faith in Chriſt, it may be omitted till they are adult, or if they ſhould die before, they who are not baptized are in no worſe condition, than they who are baptized.</p>
               <p>And is not our Author deeply baptized into the Sentiments of the <hi>Socinians</hi> in all this, and become a Diſciple of them, and the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedobaptiſts? A Son of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is taught, <hi>that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is generally neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> That it is certain by God's Word, that Children which are baptized, dying before they commit actual ſin, are undoubtedly ſaved, in the Rubrick after Baptiſm; and in the Catechiſm, Baptiſm is defined to be an <hi>outward and viſible Sign of an inward and ſpiritual Grace given unto us, ordained by Christ himſelf as a means whereby we receive the ſame, and a pledge to aſſure us thereof;</hi> and the benefit of it is this, <hi>That being by nature born in Sin and Children of Wrath, we are thereby made the Children of Grace;</hi> or as it is more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59637:21"/> expreſſed, <hi>the baptized are made Members of Chriſt, Children of God, and Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> But the <hi>Socinians</hi> reaſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apprehend how this can be.</p>
               <p>As to the other Sacrament, one Egg is not better like another, than his Diſcourſe of the Lord's Supper is with that of <hi>Smalcius,</hi> in the Doctor's Book called the <hi>Conſtant Communicant,</hi> which he that reads will find to be but a Comment on <hi>Smalcius</hi> his Text, who, as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the <hi>Socinians</hi> do, teach that this Sacrament which they call a Rite, was inſtituted only for a Remembrance of the Death of Chriſt, not that we receive any new benefit by it, or that any thing is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conveyed or ſealed to us; and ſo the words of Conſecration are interpreted by the Doctor, as by a <hi>Socinian,</hi> thus, (i. e.) <hi>This whole action which is now doing is my Body which is given for you,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>ſignifies my giving myſelf to Death for your Salvation, ſo that ye ought alway to comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate my Death by this Rite or Ceremony.</hi> And <hi>Socinus</hi> plainly denieth, <hi>that the Sacraments are ſtrengthners of our Faith, or ſeals whereby the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God are confirmed to us, or the ſtrength of heavenly Grace encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Doctor alſo calls the Sacraments Rites, makes the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per only a Grace-cup, to be commended to one another after a Feaſt, and breaking ſome Bread prepared for that uſe; and therefore we need not dread to be conſtant Communicants, or to be preciſe in our Reverence at it, as if he would have us forbear kneeling, as the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> do, leſt we ſhould be thought to Adore. On a deſign to deny that there is the preſence of Chriſt's Body or Bloud in any ſence, or that any Grace or Promiſe is thereby conveyed or ſealed to us, theſe things are ſome of them obſcurely, and ſome of them too plainly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in that Book.</p>
               <p>One general Remark more, which I formerly mention'd is, That he often ſpeaks of <hi>a Divinity of Christ,</hi> but never of his <hi>Deity,</hi> which is noted to be ſtudiouſly done by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> that though they grant our Saviour a kind of <hi>Divinity,</hi> as a Man of God, yet will not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him with the title of a <hi>Deity,</hi> as God and Man; wherein they deal with Chriſt as the <hi>Heathen</hi> dealt with their Hero's, as <hi>Servius</hi> notes on <hi>Virgil, Deos vocabant perpetuos, Divos ex Hominibus factos;</hi> or as we call our ancient Writers, <hi>Divus Anguſtinus.</hi> This is obſerved by <hi>Cloppenburgh</hi> againſt <hi>Smalcius,</hi> that he allowed our Saviour to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Partaker of the Divine Nature, which St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. which may be attributed to all holy Men. <hi>Smalcius</hi> placing in his Frontiſpiece the 9th Verſe of <hi>Col.</hi> 2. keeps to this word, and thus renders it, <hi>In Christ dwelt all the fulneſs of the Divinity bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> on which <hi>Cloppenburgh</hi> obſerves, that with <hi>Smalcius</hi> the Deity and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59637:21"/> Divinity do differ as much as Infinite and Finite. And it is to be feared, that the Doctor hath the ſame Notion, though not only our Tranſlation, but <hi>Pagnine</hi> and <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> read, as we do, the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for he ſtill keeps to the word <hi>Divinity,</hi> when he ſpeaks of Chriſt, as <hi>Smalcius</hi> did before him.</p>
               <p>Another Remark is, his depraving the nature and neceſſity of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Faith, and ſetting Reaſon and Natural Religion above and againſt it.</p>
               <p>Here, firſt, I remark how well the Doctor agrees with <hi>Volkelius</hi> in his Diſcourſe of Faith, <hi>There are,</hi> ſaith the Doctor, <hi>but two Articles of Faith at most, and ſometime they are reduced to one, and either of them Faith and Repentance, There are,</hi> ſaith Volkelius, <hi>two general Precepts of the Goſpel, Faith and Repentance, which are ſometime joyned in one Precept, and ſometime in diſtinct Precepts, De fide.</hi> And he mentions the ſame of the Goſpel as our Doctor often doth, <hi>That if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and believe in thy heart that God raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> But then <hi>Volkelius</hi> by this Faith means an effectual opperative Faith, (which all that profeſs to believe both theſe Articles have not) and to which we appropriate Salvation; and therefore the Doctor's diſputing in general of a <hi>Notional Faith,</hi> and a <hi>Credulity,</hi> as he calls it, and under that Notion condemns, is a Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical way of arguing, much worſe than any that <hi>Volkelius</hi> himſelf is guilty of; for he diſcourſeth of ſuch a Faith as includes Repentance and Evangelical Obedience, not ſuch as is the effect of Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but of the Opperation of the Spirit of Patefaction, as he calls it, but more plainly ſuch as he deſcribes from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. <hi>The natural man</hi> (ſuch as he ſaith are all that are deſtitute of the Divine Spirit) <hi>doth not underſtand the things of the ſpirit of God;</hi> and v. 9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen nor ear heard, nor the mind conceived what things God hath prepared for them that love him, but God hath revealed them to us by his ſpirit,</hi> Spiritu Patifactionis, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 14. If theſe and other Opinions of <hi>Volkelius</hi> be compared with our Doctor's Natural Faith, it would appear to any impartial Reader, that the Doctor is the groſſer <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> of the two.</p>
               <p>On this Subject he ſpends ſeveral Chapters, the Contents of the firſt is to ſhew, he ſays, <hi>in what ſence Faith juſtifies;</hi> but indeed he ſhews that it doth not juſtifie; and firſt he condemns it as the unhappy Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the <hi>Gnoſticiſm</hi> which ſo much troubled St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by corrupting the Diſciples minds from the Simplicity of the Goſpel, which is all he ſays; and he might as well charge good Laws with all the Villanies that are committed againſt them; for the Scripture had foretold <hi>there muſt be Hereſies, and there would be Schiſms, and that men would walk af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59637:22"/> their own luſts, and deny the Lord that bought them;</hi> though the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Faith do no more cauſe theſe than the Sun doth thoſe Works of Darkneſs, which are committed in its light. To make amends for this, he ſays, 2ly, <hi rend="margSglQuotes">That it is ſo happy as to be honoured by our Lord and his Apoſtles as to be made the ſole Condition of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> But after this he asks, <hi>p.</hi> 10. <hi rend="margSglQuotes">And now what need of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, of running the Gantelope of Mortification, croſſing our Appetites, and afflicting our Souls?</hi> As if the Doctrine of Faith did not include or preſuppoſe Repentance, or as if any ſort of Repentance were available without Faith, and as if the merit of good Works were a neceſſary and efficacious Ingredient to the Cauſe of Juſtification; for thus he joyns Juſtification by Works upon account of Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion with Juſtification by Faith upon account of the Goſpel. Hence in the 12th Page he makes a large Harangue, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi rend="margSglQuotes">What are the great merits of Faith which may any way entitle it to ſo great a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as Everlaſting Life? Whatever can pretend to worth, muſt make its claim good by ſhewing how it partaketh the Nature of God who is the firſt Good; but to be credulous is ſo far from the power of Divine Life, that it is a plain confeſſion of Weakneſs, it is nothing elſe but leaning on another for want of knowledge of its own: <hi>The ſimple believeth every word, but a wiſe man looketh well to his going,</hi> ſaid the wiſeſt of all Men; and experience tells us, that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Dotards, Women and Fools, the Sick and Ignorant are moſt eaſie, and by how much any Man is wiſer, by ſo much he is warier that he be not impoſed on. Had it any worth we ſhould have heard of it in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and the Philoſophers would have allowed it a place among the Vertues: and the Old Teſtament men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it but once or twice, and that not by way of Precept, but occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionly; and what reward can it poſſibly deſerve, if I believe either I do it on good reaſon or not, if I ſee good reaſon for my belief, I cannot deſerve reward, becauſe no Man can chooſe but muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily believe as far as reaſon requires; if I believe without reaſon, then I am a Fool, and ſo far from deſerving a reward, that I deſerve blame; and if it ſeem hard to juſtify our Lord's wiſdom in promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſo great a reward to a performance that deſerves none at all, it will appear no leſs ſo to juſtify his goodneſs in impoſing ſuch a Task no leſs difficult than worthleſs; for whereas no ſmall part of the good Tidings of the Goſpel is our Manumiſſion from the Burden of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, the Yoke of Chriſt will ſeem harder of the two; it is eaſier for a rich Man to ſacrifice whole Hecatombs, when he hath Wealth enough to purchaſe them, than to pull out his Eyes; yet can a Man eaſier pull out the eye of his Body, than his Reaſon, which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59637:22"/> is not only the eye but the heart, for it is his very definition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he cannot be a Man, it is God's Image; and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle exhorts us to put on the new Man, which is renewed in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge after the Image of him that created him: Now that God ſhould print his Image in our hearts, require us to renew it, yet promiſe eternal Life for reward if we deface it, is a ſaying harder to be believed, than all the Ceremonies of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law were to be practiſed. This and more, ſays he, is objected againſt Faith in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and againſt what Faith, but in particular againſt that of the Holy Trinity, and the Eternal Deity of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when the Doctor ſo induſtriouſly ſuggeſts all theſe Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt Faith, and takes no care to aſſoile them, he betrays that Cauſe which he would ſeem to defend, as it will appear in his fourth Chapter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Socinians</hi> affirm with our Doctor, <hi>That nothing muſt be believed that cannot be apprehended and underſtood by Reaſon.</hi> To this we ſay, that it is not contrary to any Principle of right Reaſon, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Creator and Law-giver, in revealing his will, ſhould propoſe Articles to be aſſented to, upon his own Authority revealing them, though his Creatures cannot by their Reaſon apprehend how thoſe Articles ſhould be true: Divine Faith is grounded on a Divine Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony as it is Divine,<note place="margin">T<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                  <hi>Neque enim quia bonum est id circo auſculture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus, ſed quia Deus precepit;</hi> For we do obey the Command not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we judge it good, but becauſe God commands it. And as St. <hi>Auguſtin, Judicatur ad id quod poſſumus creditur ad quod non poſſumus;</hi> How can the corrupt and finite reaſon of Man comprehend the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of an Alwiſe and Infinite God. We allow to all Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors ſome <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> which the Vulgar cannot judge of; and ſhall we not allow it to the only Wiſe God, the Governor of the World? is there nothing above the ſphear of natural Reaſon? How then comes it to paſs, that it is baffled in ſo many natural things? in Sympathies, and Antipathies, and Occult Qualities, the Effects where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are demonſtrated, but the Cauſes cannot be known; And ſhall Man preſume by his ſhort line of Reaſon, and Diſcourſe, to fathom the deep things of God, which the Apoſtle ſays <hi>are paſt finding out?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay, (though it be contrary to Reaſon and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) <hi>That Divine Worſhip must be given to a Creature,</hi> (as they affirm Chriſt to be) why may not the ſame Scriptures be believed, when they tell us, that Chriſt is One, and equal with the Father, God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though Reaſon cannot apprehend how the Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence can be communicated to more than one Perſon, yet is it good Logick, (though no <hi>Socinian</hi> Reaſon) that though the Divine Eſſence
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59637:23"/> be ſingular, yet it may be predicated of more than One, without Multiplication or Diviſion.</p>
               <p>But are the <hi>Socinians</hi> the only Maſters of Reaſon, that all Mankind muſt ſtand or fall at their Tribunal? Are they the Light of the World, and all Men elſe in Darkneſs? Yea, even Chriſt himſelf, who hath taught many things as contrary to their Doctrines, as Light is to Darkneſs; then we may ſay, that neither God is true, as well as that all Men are Lyars. The <hi>Socinians</hi> grant, <hi>That the Man that makes Reaſon his Judge, ought to have divers neceſſary qualifications, as that his Reaſon be clear and uncorrupt, that the Perſon be of great Probi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Sincerity, free from Vice and prejudicate Opinions, well inſtructed and exerciſed in Human and Divine Knowledge, one that hath ſtudied, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſed, and meditated on the Things he doubts of, conſidering what is ſaid</hi> pro <hi>and</hi> con <hi>by learned Men.</hi> And when all theſe Things meet, one thing more is neceſſary, the Illumination and Aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God: And hath this Spirit and ſound Reaſon forſaken the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church in all Ages, and confined itſelf to the <hi>Raccovian</hi> Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſts? or is every private Man thus qualified? Are not the moſt, carnal, ignorant, or obſtinate, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth, being lead away with divers Luſts, which darken their Underſtandings, and cauſe them to impriſon the Truth of God in Unrighteouſneſs, and lean more to their own Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, than to the Revelation and Aſſiſtance of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: I doubt not, but the <hi>Socinians</hi> will grant, that ſuch Men are not fit Judges for themſelves, or others, in Matters of Salvation; Who then ſhall judge for them? If they chooſe another, it will be proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly one of whom they have ſuch a good Opinion, as moſt inclined to their own Sentiments: And how are they aſſured that he is not taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome of the ſame Failings as himſelf is, he ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conſider what the Church of GOD hath held in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, what the moſt general Councils, after mature deliberation, have approved of; and above all, what is moſt conſonant to the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament, and make theſe his Rule, and then he will plainly ſee, how contrary the long approved Doctrines of Original Sin, and of Eternal Death, the Wages of Sin, the Neceſſity of Satisfaction to the Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and in order thereto, the Incarnation of the Son of God, which are as clear in the Holy Scriptures, as the Sun in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are to his clouded and carnal Reaſon; we may not wonder, that there are in all Ages Men of perverſe Minds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe we have been foretold, there ſhould be ſuch; or that the Sophiſtry of ſuch Men, may raiſe prejudices againſt the moſt evident Truths, even
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59637:23"/> againſt the Being of a Deity, and the firſt Principles of any Religion; but for any who hold the Scriptures to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and yet deny the Fundamentals of the Religion therein taught, and ſhine as the Sun, throughout one end to the other, is againſt Reaſon as well as Scripture; what is more plain, than the Creation of the World by God, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. yet may an Atheiſt urge the ſame Reaſon by his Metaphorical Senſe of that Hiſtory, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> do, by their abſurd Interpretation of that of St. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. and apply the particulars of the Hiſtory of the Creation, to the Erection of the Jewiſh Pedagogy, and Policy by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as the <hi>Socinians</hi> do the firſt Inſtitution of the Chriſtian Religion, to be the Senſe of the Creation of the World by Chriſt, <hi>Who was with God, and was that God by whom the World was made;</hi> as is moſt expreſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. See the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> againſt <hi>Crellius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence is it that the Ancient Fathers and Modern Doctors have loſt their Reaſon, and the <hi>Socinians</hi> found it, that they, as the <hi>Chineſes</hi> ſay, are the eye of the World, <hi>Quid eſt quod Velleius intellegere poſſit, contra non poſſit,</hi> as <hi>Cicero de Natura Deorum:</hi> Sure they have as good Intellectuals, and as good helps to improve them, and have given as great Teſtimonies of their Probity, as any <hi>Socinian</hi> whatſoever; their boaſt of Reaſon therefore may be checkt with that of <hi>Lucan</hi> of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Druids: <hi>Solis noſce Deos &amp; Coeli numina vobis, aut Solis neſcire datur. Socinus</hi> grants, <hi>That we ought not to forſake the common and uſual ſence of the Scripture,</hi> (and apply a Metaphorical Senſe) <hi>when the matter is capable of it:</hi> And if his Diſciples would grant but one thing more, <hi>viz.</hi> that we ought not to wreſt little words and particles, which may admit of various ſignifications, contrary to their common import, to which the ſubject matter doth determine them, the Controverſies between us and them would be ſoon decided; for as the R. R. Biſhop notes, concerning that great Point of the Satisfaction of Chriſt, (which is ſo obſtinately denied) that it cannot be more clearly expreſſed by any Man, than it is in the Scripture; and if any Company of Learned Men ſhould purpoſely write of it, as the Apoſtles have done, the <hi>Socinians</hi> would find the like evaſions from the Sence of the one, as they have to elude the other.</p>
               <p>We ſay then, that no Man of ſober Reaſon, aſſiſted by the Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Word and Spirit of God, can diſſent from the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Goſpel; becauſe firſt, it doth propoſe ſuch things as are above the reach of human Reaſon, but not contrary to it; for one Light may be greater than another, but not contrary to another; and that Mind or Reaſon which is improved and elevated by the Light of Faith, beyond the Sphere of its natural activity, and is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a ſpiritual underſtanding, doth not only believe thoſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59637:24"/> Myſteries to be true, but alſo may perceive many Reaſons for their credibility, which are hid from others that have not the ſame Opticks; ſuch as he may infer from the Wiſdom of God, who propoſeth them, and from the Nature of the Things propoſed. And if the <hi>Socinians</hi> talk of human Reaſon in the Concreate, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> ſuch as yet remain in the natural and corrupted Man, of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. it cannot be expected that this ſhould agree with the Goſpel; for if to the eye of the body, many things appear otherwiſe than in truth they are, which Reaſon doth correct, as an Oar in the Water ſeems broken to the view of the eye, which Reaſon tells us is ſtill ſtrait and ſound; and Reaſon demonſtrates the Sun to be more than Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times greater than the Globe of the Earth, though to our ſight it appear not above four or five Foot in diameter; Why may not the eye of Faith as much excel that of Reaſon, as that of Reaſon doth the corporeal ſence? As for the Quotations of <hi>Volkelius</hi> from <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Of our reaſonable ſervice;</hi> it doth not prove, that Evangelical Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as preſcribed, ought to be meaſured by human Reaſon; but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that ſuch Worſhip is juſt and reaſonable, as well as ſpiritual, in oppoſition to the carnal Worſhip under the Law; where Sheep and Doves were offered to God, which were unreaſonable Creatures, and dead Sacrifices; whereas now we are to offer up ourſelves a living Sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God; in which reſpect it is called a reaſonable Service.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Platoniſts</hi> were Maſters of as much Natural Reaſon as the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,</hi> and if they, on I know not what Tradition and Enquiry, did believe a plurality of Perſons in the Godhead, it is ſtrange, that the <hi>Socinians</hi> by the help of the Scripture, ſhould not yield their aſſent.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Platoniſts</hi> had no temptation nor intereſt to lead them to the Notion of a <gap reason="foreign">

Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſays, <hi>That Christ was known in part to</hi> Socrates, <hi>under the Notion of Reaſon, which foretold things future; and taking the ſame Infirmities as we, hath inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us by himſelf.</hi> And that the Opinions of <hi>Plato</hi> are not very remote from thoſe which we have of Chriſt, St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> agrees with him, that changing a few Words and Sentences, they would become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as ſome of the later <hi>Platonicks</hi> have done. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſays, <hi>That when the Chriſtians ſay, that God made the World by his Reaſon, they ſpeak after the manner of the Sage Heathen.</hi> Tertul. Apology.</p>
               <p>Now if the Heathen ſaw ſo much, (by whatever means) as to give their aſſent to a plurality of Hypoſtaſes, or Perſonalities in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, our Maſters of Reaſon, the <hi>Socinians,</hi> ſeem to contradict the wiſer ſort of Philoſophers, as well as the generality of Chriſtians, in their Opinions.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that write the Hiſtory of the <hi>Pagans</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> do aſſure us, that among ſome of them, there are Notions of the Trinity ſtill preſerved; and it is ſuppoſed, that by Tradition from the Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> in whoſe <hi>Cabala</hi> there were ſome dark Speeches concerning the Trinity; which though they were careful not to make known to the Heathen, yet ſome Notions of it were entertained and ſpread abroad into the World.</p>

               <p>So that the Notion of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> did paſs among the <hi>Jews,</hi> for the Son of God, under the Name of the Word of God. The <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> alſo, and <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> uſed it in the ſame ſence, which gave occaſion to St. <hi>John</hi> to deſcribe our Saviour by that Word which was left known in thoſe days, and to aſſert the Divinity of our Saviour under that Word; which he doth ſo effectually, that the <hi>Socinians</hi> finding they could not object againſt it, have thought on a New Expoſition, and a New Creation made by this Word; which as it hath no Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being <hi>ex nihilo,</hi> ſo it reſolves into nothing: but the Word of God ſhall endure for ever.

               <p>The Objection which he ſays hath a Sting, <hi>p.</hi> 13. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. is this, <hi>That Faith hath no place among Vertues, but Credulity hath among Vices:</hi> The Doctor well knows, that the Faith we of the Church of <hi>England</hi> do profeſs, is ſuch a Faith, as for the Objects of it, is contained in the Creeds, which we receive, and ſuch as for the nature of it, doth work by Love, and doth both purifie the heart and makes the Believer fruitful in every good Work; a Faith that keeps us humble and holy, not preſuming to be juſtified by the merit of any Works of our own, but through the Satisfaction made by Chriſt, for which God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept us and our ſincere Obedience, not imputing our Sins to us: Moreover, we acknowledge this Faith to be the Gift and the Work of God in us, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.28. and St. <hi>Paul, To you it is given not only to believe, but to ſuffer;</hi> And <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. <hi>By faith ye are ſaved, and that not of yourſelves, it is the gift of God,</hi> Epheſ. 2.8.</p>
               <p>This is the Faith which he would make as Naked as his Goſpel; as if it were an effect of natural Reaſon as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> hold, and wholly in our power, without any operation of the Spirit of Chriſt; without whom we can do nothing, as to obtaining of the Grace of Faith, or bringing forth the Fruits of Holineſs: If this be the Faith which he oppoſeth, a belief of the Holy Trinity, the Redemption of Mankind by the Eternal Son of God, the Operation of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in our Sanctification, as it clearly appears, he leaves all Chriſtians in a State of Nature, without any remedy by the Fountain of Grace, of whoſe Fulneſs we have all received grace for grace.</p>

               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:59637:27"/>
               <p>Another Commendation of Natural Faith is, <hi>That it is a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter of Obedience; wherein the Old Teſtament being ſilent,</hi> as he ſays, he ſends us to <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. in the New Teſtament, <hi>But had not thoſe worthies any notice of the promiſed ſeed?

                  <hi>Did not</hi> Abraham <hi>receive his</hi> Iſaac <hi>in a type?</hi> v. 19. <hi>Did not</hi> Moſes <hi>ſee him who is inviſible, and had reſpect to the recompence of reward?</hi> v. 26, 27. <hi>Did not he write of Chriſt?

               </p>
               <p>If all theſe were the fruits and effects of a Natural Faith, I cannot ſee what need there was of the Goſpel; if Nature ſhewed the way to Life and Immortality, which 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. ſays <hi>was brought to light by the Goſpel;</hi> if it taught ſo much Obedience, Conſtancy, and Patience, how can Chriſt ſay,<note place="margin">John 14.6</note>

This it ſeems the Doctor would teach the Apoſtle, for <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3. This I would learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the Works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith? was this hearing of Faith the voice of Nature, or the preaching of the Goſpel?

They indeed taught us the will of God, and gave us Divine as well as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Precepts; but Chriſt only can write them in our hearts, he only can pardon our ſins, having obtained Remiſſion at the expence of his own Blood: We therefore joyn with the Doctor in recommending the Duties of Natural Religion, and ſay theſe ought we to do, but by no means to leave the Duties of Evangelical Faith undone or disbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for though that hath done vertuouſly in many reſpects, yet this excelleth them all.</p>

Our Doctor mentions it for another reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> how any Church dare challenge, or any Man dares pay that Faith to any, yea, all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth, which is due to God only. And on the <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Arian</hi> ſuppoſition, that Chriſt is a Creature, there is no more Faith or Obedience due to him, than to other Meſſengers of God, but we muſt ſeek for Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a Natural Religion, and then, blind as we are by Nature, and having but blind Guides, we may ſoon fall into the Ditch; <hi>For the natural man perceiveth not the things of the ſpirit; fleſh and bloud cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal them, nor can any man ſay that Jeſus is the Christ, but by the Holy Ghost:</hi> That this ſeems to be the <hi>Socinian</hi> ſence of the Author, is prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able from the following words, <hi>Thoſe who require implicit Faith on any other authority, ſo as to contradict reaſon, give God the lye, making him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelf; for Reaſon is no leſs the word of God, than is the Scripture:</hi> So that if the Doctrines of the Goſpel contradict the Reaſon of <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> they are not to be received; for therefore only are we to believe the Scripture, becauſe we are by plain Reaſon convinced that it is the Word of God: But what if ſome <hi>Socinians</hi> be tainted with <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> and their Reaſon tells them, the Goſpel is not the Word of God, but that Word is written in their Hearts, and the Light within them is the only Word of God, and not the Word incarnate, or that which is written with Pen and Inke: that is in our Doctor's Opinion the Natural Religion; for though the evidence we have, that what is offered us for the Word of God, is really ſuch, to this we muſt pay neither more nor leſs belief than Reaſon will prove due, <hi>p.</hi> 18. <hi>col.</hi> 2.</p>

                  <hi>P.</hi> 19. <hi>c.</hi> 2. The Doctor ſpeaking of Belief, ſays thus: <hi>The ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion which claimed it as due to God, forbad to pay it to any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, upon the former account there was no need of an expreſs Precept, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the later there was the greatest need, not only of an expreſs Command, but ſuch repeated Importunities as might out voice both Reaſon when it ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59637:28"/> ſuch a Command, and Interest when it ſhould rebel against convinced Reaſon; both whereof concurred against the belief which our Lord required.</hi> The ſence of this Paragraph ſeems to be this, That as the Faith which Natural Religion claims as due to God, needed no expreſs Precept; ſo Natural Religion forbidding to pay Faith to any Creature, there was the greateſt need not only of an expreſs Command, but repeated Importunities to pay it to Chriſt, ſuch as might out-voice both Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Intereſt, ſeeing they both concurred againſt the belief which our Lord required: I wiſh the Doctor would give a more rational inference from theſe words then this, that both Natural Religion, Reaſon and Intereſt do forbid to pay Faith to Chriſt, as forbidding to pay it to a Creature; for he ſaith <hi>they concur against the belief which our Lord required.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Doctor by implicit Faith means more particularly a readineſs to believe, as Articles of Faith, and as neceſſary to Salvation, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Propoſitions are impoſed on him by his Superiors, he well knows we have no ſuch Cuſtom in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> we call no Man on Earth our Maſter or Law-giver in Matters of Faith. He that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth his own Reaſon (which is often againſt, and then it muſt be) above Scripture, he is in as bad a condition as the moſt bigotted Papiſt, for he makes himſelf and all his Faculties and Reaſonings as Infallible as they believe the Pope to be.</p>

                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. The Contents of this Chapter is thus expreſs'd: <hi>Why Faith under the Goſpel maketh a greater figure than under the Law?</hi> This ſtate of the Queſtion he preſently alters, and makes it his buſineſs to ſhew, <hi>That when our Saviour first claimed the publick profeſſion of Faith in him, there were extraordinary reaſons for his Importunity and Promiſes, ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in theſe days, when the Chriſtian Religion hath been long eſtabliſhed, have lost their influence, and by conſequence the importunity of thoſe Precepts, and the influence of thoſe Promiſes do now ceaſe.</hi> Theſe extraordinary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>(viz.)</hi> for profeſſing Faith in Chriſt, he draws from, 1. The Difficulty; and 2. the Danger of profeſſing Faith in Chriſt; and 3. the Neceſſity of it: All which, are readily granted, <hi>viz.</hi> That though it were both difficult and dangerous, yet it was neceſſary that the Diſciples of Chriſt ſhould publickly own Faith in him: but then the Inference which he makes is not concluſive, <hi>p.</hi> 23. <hi>col.</hi> 1. (viz.) <hi>Now that our Education makes it as difficult, and our Laws as dangerous to deny Christ, as it was then to confeſs him, and conſequently what extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary merit Faith might draw from thoſe Topicks, muſt now be lowered; and ſo Faith will appear a common Grace, worthy of no greater than common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi> Is falſe, for (as he confeſſeth) though in extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, that neceſſity be now abated, yet there is a permament neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59637:28"/> from the influence which Faith alway hath on the action of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, becauſe as he ſays, <hi>The Chriſtian is alway a Souldier, and must fight againſt all kinds of Enemies to Christ's Kingdom, not only Fleſh and Bloud, but ſpiritual Wickedneſs, and whatever would not have the Lord rule over them.</hi> He muſt follow the Captain of his Salvation, who was made perfect by Sufferings; and when tempted he muſt walk in the ſteps of his Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſacrifice his Luſts, though no leſs dear than was his <hi>Iſaac:</hi> So that Faith muſt be habitually the ſame, and therefore needs the ſame encouragements now as it did when it was firſt required.</p>
               <p>And I ſee no great need of that which he ſo carefully requires, that we muſt diſtinguiſh the times, for we are ſtill under thoſe later times which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>perillous,</hi> wherein we ſhall meet with divers Tryals and Temptation, and therefore need the whole Armor of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And we ſtill need the ſame degrees of Faith to overcome the World, (i. e.) <hi>The luſt of the Fleſh, the luſt of the Eyes, and the pride of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this great Work he ſays Chriſt came furniſhed with no other power, but of working Miracles; but the Scripture tells us of other powers, for St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>Grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> He had the power to confer Grace, to give Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins, to give Faith, and to increaſe it, to open the eyes of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and turn them from Darkneſs unto Light, and from the power of Satan to God; without which powers that of working Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles was inſufficient; for we read of many that wrought Miracles in Chriſt's name, and yet had no ſaving Faith: and a Heathen may have a Natural Faith and Moral Vertues, and yet come ſhort of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>He adds in the concluſion of this Chapter, <hi>That if we believe him,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Chriſt, to require Faith for any other reaſon than as it is neceſſary for our encouragement to Holineſs, in order to Happineſs, we diſhonour him, becauſe no other reaſon is worthy of his Majeſty or Goodneſs.</hi> This indeed is one great end, <hi>viz.</hi> our Salvation, in which the Glory of God and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour are alſo concern'd; that as we believe in God we ſhould alſo believe in Chriſt,<note place="margin">John 5.</note> and that all Men ſhould <hi>honour the Son as they honour the Father, and the honour of the Son tends to the honour of the Father;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we need Faith in the Merits of Chriſt and his Interceſſion and Mediation to preſent our Prayers to God, and that we may come boldly to the Throne of Grace.</p>
               <p>Nor doth this derogate from the Glory due to God, for all tends to the Glory of God the Father; And <hi>he that honoreth not the Son,</hi>

               <p>So that what the Doctor urgeth to the diſparagement of Faith, <hi>That the Precepts requiring Faith, and the Promiſes encouraging it, were calculated for thoſe Primitive Times, and are now ceaſed,</hi> is to recommend Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and not Faith; and plain it is, that his chief deſign is, to exalt Natural Religion, on the Ruins of Chriſtian Faith, which will alſo take off the Motives and Encouragements to Obedience and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>

                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. In this Chapter he enquires what are thoſe ſaving Truths to the belief whereof Eternal Life is promiſed; <hi>Theſe truths,</hi> he ſays, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Perſon in whom, or the Word which we believe on credit of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> Here he enquires firſt, what kind of Perſon our Saviour requires us to believe him to be; this Perſon he deſcribes from 7 <hi>Dan.</hi> 13. <hi>To be one to whom was given dominion and glory, and a kingdom that all nations and kingdoms ſhould ſerve him:</hi> The Title there given him is the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> which in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Idiom imports the eminence of the Subject ſpoken of; that is, a Man of ſome ſingular note, but a Man ſtill. Another Idiom of the <hi>Jews</hi> for advancing a thing or Perſon, was to intitle it to God, as Rivers of God, and Mountains of God; ſo Man of God, and Son of God, by <hi>Daniel</hi> are made a Character of the greateſt Beauty and Majeſty, but a Creature ſtill. He mentioneth alſo that Character which Chriſt aſſumed, <hi>The only begotten Son of God;</hi> theſe Characters ſpeak him a Perſon of ſuper-eminent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable Greatneſs, like his Emblem the Light, and that is but a Creature; which whatever the Traveller believes it to be, ſtill it is his faithful Guide: But have we no other benefit from the Sun but its light only? Doth it not alſo warm, comfort, and enliven us? Yet the Scriptures gives more noble operations to Faith, it is as much the life of the Soul, as the Soul is of the Body, it gives ſpirit and motion to every faculty of the Soul; ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live, yet not I but Chriſt liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himſelf for me.</hi> But our Doctor fruſtrates this Grace of God, for if Righteouſneſs come by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vain; what good can the Light do to a Traveller that wants legs and life, or that is blind from his birth. As to his two Idioms, I only ask the Doctor, Why, when that Scripture calls Chriſt the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> it means a Man of Eminence and Perfection? So when it calls him the <hi>Son of God,</hi> doth it not mean a perfect and ſupreme God?</p>
               <p>The Doctor objects from <hi>John</hi> 10.36. that our Saviour ſpake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing what he had been from Eternity, when, if ever, he ought to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59637:29"/> have done it, but only what he was in relation to other Meſſengers of God.</p>

               <p>This of St. <hi>John</hi> being one of the beſt pieces of Armor wherein the <hi>Socinians</hi> put their truſt, to defend themſelves againſt all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for our Saviour's Deity, we muſt trie what Mettle it is made of; <hi>P.</hi> 28. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. he thus infers: <hi rend="margSglQuotes">That it ſeemeth plain, as by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evidence, ſo by Chriſt's own words, that a practical Faith is all that our Saviour requires; for when the <hi>Jews</hi> came about him, and ſaid, How long doſt thou make us to doubt, if thou be the Chriſt, tell us plainly. And he in anſwer thereto called God his Father: They took up Stones to ſtone him, becauſe (ſaid they) thou being a Man makeſt thyſelf God. He did not on ſo urgent occaſion aſſert his Right, but abating ſo much as exceeded their comprehenſion, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied himſelf (that he might ſatisfy them) with what might be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for their Conviction to Salvation.

               <p>This Scripture is made the Corner-ſtone of all the <hi>Socinian Babel,</hi> which they endeavour with all their Art and Might to eſtabliſh, and raiſe as a Tower of Defence againſt the Power of Heaven and Earth.

               </p>
               <p>We ſhall meet this Gentleman again anon, in the mean time we muſt not be uncivil to the Doctor, who hath been ſo civil as to grant, That Chriſt was firſt ſanctified and afterward ſent; whereas others were firſt ſent into the World the common way, and afterward ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: To them God ſent his Word by their Betters, but it is not ſent to me by my Betters, but by me to my Inferiors. Now if Chriſt were firſt ſanctified and then ſent into the World, then he had a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before he came into the World, and that Being muſt be as a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator or a Creature, or a middle Nature, a made God as the <hi>Arians</hi> call him; the <hi>Arians</hi> ſay more, <hi>That he was God's Inſtrument or Agent in creating the World;</hi> which is ſo evident in the Scripture, that no Man of ſence can deny, that diligently reads <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Now if God to qualify him for ſo great a Work as that of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did communicate to him the great Attributes of Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Omnipotence and Omniſſience, which are Infinite, why might he not communicate to him alſo that other Attribute of his Eternity in his Generation. But to come to the Doctor's Argument, viz. <hi>That Chriſt ſpake nothing to the</hi> Jews <hi>of what he was from Eternity in himſelf, but what he was in relation to the World:</hi> Doth not the Doctor grant he was firſt ſanctified, and then ſent into the World? And what is that Sanctification, but his being ordained by God to be the Redeemer and Saviour of the World? So <hi>Crellius</hi> ſays, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 31. To ſanctify ſignifieth in Scripture to ſeparate one, and chooſe him to a ſingular Office.</p>
               <p>Now Chriſt by an everlaſting Decree was ſet apart to be the Lamb ſlain, as an All ſufficient Sacrifice for the Sins of all Mankind: his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification or Ordination to the Office of a Redeemer, was by that Decree of which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> gives us a Copy, Pſal. 2. <hi>I will declare the decree, the Lord hath ſaid to me, Thou art my Son, this day have I begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thee;</hi> which the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> affirm to be ſpoken of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> And the <hi>Hodie,</hi> the day was from all Eternity; for the Redemption of Mankind could not be effected but by an Infinite Price, as Scripture teacheth.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:59637:30"/>
               <p>The Argument urged by our Doctor, and the <hi>Socinians,</hi> is, <hi>That our Saviour on ſo preſſing an occaſion ought to aſſert his Right, yet ſpake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what he was from Eternity:</hi> So Crellius, <hi>and our Doctor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we affirm, that our Saviour was not obliged ſo to do on this occaſion, it was ſufficient for him to clear himſelf from the Accuſation of being a Blaſphemer, which he doth by an Argument out of their own Law, which may be thus illuſtrated: The Doctor ſtiles himſelf, A true Son of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> to which it may be ſaid, that he being an <hi>Arian</hi> or <hi>Socinian,</hi> doth blaſpheme, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> ſpeaks evil of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in making himſelf, who is a <hi>Socinian,</hi> a true Son of that Church, which owns no ſuch for her Sons, that are of that Belief. Now how will the Doctor vindicate himſelf from this Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation? will he ſay, <hi>I was baptized into the Faith of that Church, in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> I was for Twenty five Years a Profeſſor of Divinity in that Church, a Rector of <hi>Exeter</hi>-Colledge. This would be an impertinent Argument; for there have been many of that Church which are gone from it, ſome to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> others to <hi>Socinian</hi> Conventicles: the moſt proper Argument would have been, to ſhew, that in our Law, the Articles of our Religion, our Litany and Homilies, the <hi>Arrian</hi> Religion, or <hi>Socinian</hi> Religion aſſerted; or that neither in his Writings or Sermons he hath affirmed any other Doctrine than what is eſtabliſhed in that Church: for the Queſtion is not, concerning the Dignity of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or his Birth or Qualifications; but whether he be a true Son of that Church, and can ſhew the conſonancy of his Faith to that of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> This was our Saviour's Argument to vindicate himſelf from the Jews Accuſation, who accounted him a Blaſphemer, in that he being a Man made himſelf the Son of God; he doth not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from his being the Son of God, or from his doing ſuch Works as no other Man did; but proves from their Law, wherein the Title of God is given to Men that were inferiour to him, <hi>viz.</hi> to Princes, Prieſts, and Prophets; he was not concern'd to tell them, whether he was the Son of God, by diſtinguiſhing between a Son of God by Nature, and a Son by Office; he doth not deny, but ſtill aſſerts the firſt, both before <hi>v.</hi> 30. <hi>I and my Father are one:</hi> and after <hi>ver.</hi> 38. <hi>The Father is in me, and I in him.</hi> And his being ſanctified, and ſent into the World, proves the ſame, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that he was the Son of God; for otherwiſe God ſent not his Son, and ſanctified him before he came into the World; but firſt ſent him into the World, and then ſanctified him to be his Son; which though contrary to what the Doctor grants from the Text; yet the <hi>Socinians</hi> generally deny, and aſcribe his Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to his Birth, his Baptiſm, Unction, to his Office; his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59637:31"/> and Exaltation, on any thing but his Eternal Generation, and Ordination, to be the Saviour and Redeemer of the World; for which Office all the Angels of God were not ſufficient.</p>
               <p>And now we return to the thoughtful Gentleman:</p>
               <p>This Gentleman thinks to thruſt home this Argument to the Ruin of the Catholick Doctrine; <hi>For,</hi> he ſays, <hi>it is written with the Finger of Truth, and unanſwerable,</hi> p. 3. col. 2. <hi>But that the Orthodox are wont to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all ſorts of Contradictions, and to caſt duſt in the eyes of the ſimple.</hi> This Reproach notwithſtanding, we will go hand in hand with him, in ſearch of that Truth, which this Scripture propounds; for we are agreed, that our Saviour delivers his Doctrine in profound Wiſdom, having regard to the Circumſtances of Place, Time, and Perſon; by theſe Particulars we ſhall examine the Text, laying down this general Obſervation, That St. <hi>John</hi> was deſired by the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> who were peſtered with the Hereſies of the <hi>Gnoſticks, Ebion,</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> who denied the Deity of the Son of God, and aſcribed the Creation to certain <hi>Aeones,</hi> or Angels, denying it to be aſcribed to Chriſt; both which Errors he particularly refutes: 1. Then conſider the Perſons with whom he had to do in this Chapter, they were ſuch as our Saviour had exaſperated againſt himſelf, calling them Thieves and Robbers, that came to no other end, but to kill and deſtroy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he came to give them Eternal Life; which St. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. ſays, was the end of his Writing the Goſpel: <hi>That ye might believe, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, and that believing, ye might have life through his name.</hi> This our Saviour proves, ſtiling himſelf the good Shepherd, that came to lay down his Life for his Sheep, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> all that ſhould hear his Voice; and that they might not doubt of his power to do it, he tells them, <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again:</hi> And this he was to do by Commiſſion or Commandment from his Father, <hi>who loved him,</hi> v. 17. As being of one will with his Father in this, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>As the Father knoweth me, even ſo know I my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Again he proves his Divine Power by his Works, which were ſuch as the Jews confeſt, the Devil himſelf could not do; and to them he appeals, <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</hi> Now the ſame Divine Works in ſpecie, argues the ſame Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and therefore our Saviour tells them, <hi>I and my Father are one:</hi> that is, as the Jews themſelves underſtood him, One in Eſſence as well as in Operation: the Jews on theſe Doctrines and Arguments of our Saviour, take up Stones to ſtone him, as guilty of Blaſphemy, who being but a Man, made himſelf God; for <hi>v.</hi> 36. as Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaith, it was becauſe he ſaid, <hi>I am the Son of God:</hi> ſo that it ſeems, to be the Son of God, and to be God, were equivalent terms, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59637:31"/> ſo underſtood by the Jews; for by either of theſe they concluded, that he made himſelf equal with God. To ſilence the Jews Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he urgeth a Scripture which they own'd, being written in their Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.6. <hi>Is it not written in your Law, I ſaid ye are Gods:</hi> and the Argument is thus formed and applied, <hi>à majore ad minus.</hi> If he called them Gods, unto whom the Word of God came, ſay ye of him, whom the Father hath ſanctified and ſent into the World, thou blaſphemeſt, becauſe I ſaid I am the Son of God?</p>
               <p>This his being the Son of God, he proves by another Argument, from the Works which he did, and they acknowledged that none but God could do; therefore he argues thus: <hi>He that doth the Works of God, and ſuch as you grant none but God can do, he is God; and ye ought to believe that he is in God, and God in him,</hi> v. 38. That is, that they are of the ſame Nature and Eſſence; and in this ſence the Jews ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood him, for they ſtill ſought to take him and ſtone him. So that our Saviour ſtill maintained his Doctrine, That he was the Son of God, in that ſenſe which the Jews counted Blaſphemy; our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour doth not draw them off from their ſenſe of his being the Son of God by Nature, to a ſenſe of his being ſo only by Unction and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to a <hi>Socinian</hi> inſtead of an Orthodox. But as the Gentleman obſerves, our Saviour anſwered them in profound Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with regard to the Circumſtances of Place, Time; and Perſons; all which we ſhall now conſider, and manifeſt our Saviour's Wiſdom in reſpect of all theſe: 1. As to the Perſons, they were reſolved Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Life and Doctrine of our Saviour, and ſuch as would not believe him, though he told them never ſo plainly, as our Saviour ſays, when they ask'd him the like enſnaring Queſtion, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>If you be the Christ, tell us plainly.</hi> Jeſus anſwered them, <hi>I told you, and ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me not, becauſe you are not of my ſheep.</hi> Their preſent Honour and Intereſt was a barr to their belief: <hi>How can ye believe that ſeek the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that cometh of men, and not that which cometh of God?</hi> They under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not that plainer Parable in <hi>v.</hi> 6. of the true and falſe Shepherds. And our Saviour tells his Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>To you it is given to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of God, but to others in parables, that ſeeing they might not ſee, and hearing they might not underſtand.</hi> Theſe were thoſe obſtinate Jews, in whom was fulfilled the Prophecy of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.9. as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> relates, <hi>ch.</hi> 13.13. for this cauſe probably our Saviour in his Wiſdom thought it not fit to caſt Pearls before Swine, he knew they would not believe, though he had aſſerted his Deity never ſo expreſly.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly, As to the time, it was the Wiſdom of our Saviour, not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf to the Rage of the Jews, the Time deſigned for his Death,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59637:32"/> and the Manner of it, <hi>viz.</hi> by Crucifixion, not by Stoning, being not yet come; and he had many Doctrines to inſtruct his Diſciples more perfectly in them; ſome they could not yet bear, and ſome they knew but imperfectly, even that of the Reſurrection; and theſe things required his Preſence with them for a longer time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he withdrew himſelf from them.</p>
               <p>Unleſs this Gentleman will make himſelf wiſer than his Maker, he muſt acknowledge, that when our Saviour anſwered thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo as to ſilence their Accuſation of Blaſphemy, and ſtop their Rage who ſought to ſtone him, though he did not by that Argument which he uſed, aſſert his Deity, (which yet he ſtill maintained) that he uſed his profound Wiſdom in the Argument which he urged.</p>
               <p>But what if from this Scripture from which this Gentleman would prove, that Chriſt is called the Son of God by vertue of his Miſſion only, it ſhall appear, that he is the Son of God by Nature and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, may we not then retort, that he only caſts a Miſt on the eyes of the Simple, and hath a Spirit of Contradiction, if it ſhall appear, that the firſt Queſtion was, Whether our Saviour was the Chriſt? as it is clear, <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> If 2dly, It appears that the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> was the Natural Son of God, then this Scripture from whence he makes the Objection, will be an utter Confutation of it.</p>
               <p>Now this was the ſence which the Jews had, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that Chriſt, or the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was the Son of God, and they accuſed him of Blaſphemy, becauſe he whom they thought to be but a meer Man, made himſelf the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that is, God; for they would by no means grant him to be the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> That the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to be the Son of God, <hi>R. Sclemo</hi> proves from the ſecond <hi>Pſalm,</hi> of which he ſays, our Fathers expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> concerning the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Kiſs the Son leſt he be angry, and thou art my Son:</hi> which explains what is meant by the word Son, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that it could not agree with any other Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as that of, <hi>Be ye inſtructed, or worſhip purely:</hi> for the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> expounds himſelf; for it being ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Thou art my Son, viz.</hi> he whom the Gentiles conſpired againſt, it follows according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the ſame word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Kiſs the Son leaſt he be angry;</hi> and our Saviour applying this expreſſion to himſelf, makes it beyond doubt. So they apply <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.26. <hi>He ſhall call me, thou art my Father,</hi> &amp;c. which alſo is applied to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and that God was his Father; and that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks of Chriſt, St. <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 4.27. puts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond doubt; and that he was that Corner-ſtone, which theſe Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders refuſed, though there is not Salvation in any other, <hi>verſes</hi> 11, 12 So that in the ſenſe of the Jews, our Saviour making himſelf the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the Son of God, he made himſelf God, and did blaſpheme.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:59637:32"/>
               <p>And now having proved, that this Author cannot by all his Art, wreſt this Scripture to his <hi>Socinian</hi> ſence, I hope he will be ſo civil as to grant us the ſame advantage as he challenged for himſelf; if Chriſt being the Son of God only by Miſſion, had been the genuine ſence of St. <hi>John</hi> in this Chapter; namely, that as he would have all other Scriptures that ſpeak of Chriſt as of God, and the Son of God, ought to be accommodated and underſtood in his <hi>Socinian</hi> ſence, of being ſo only by Miſſion; ſo it being clear, that our Saviour calling himſelf the Son of God, made himſelf the Natural and Eternal Son of God, as the Jews underſtand and counted him a Blaſphemer for it, he ought to grant that thoſe other places which ſpeak of our Saviour as God, and the Son of God, ought to be underſtood of his Eternal and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Generation: And thus it is evident, that there are ſome Men who can ſwallow Contradictions and Abſurdities more groſs than this Gentleman imputes to the Orthodox; for to give Divine Worſhip to one whom we acknowledge to be a meer Man, is a boldfac'd contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the Firſt Commandment, and to our Saviour's Command of worſhipping the Lord God, and ſerving him only; whereas if we acknowledge One God only, and believe that this Supreme God ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in Three Perſons; this cannot be accounted a Contradiction, it is ſomething above our apprehenſions, through our ignorance of the Nature and Operations of the Supreme Deity, which cannot be fully known unto us, it is above our Reaſon, but not contrary to it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is agreeable to Divine Revelation, as the Harmony of the Old and New Teſtament, and the Reaſon and Judgment of the moſt and beſt Divines in all Ages have aſſerted. If a ſober and learned Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſhould diligently read the Goſpel of St. <hi>John,</hi> and find the words, God, and Son of God, ſo often aſcribed to him, and ſuch Divine Works done by him, and conſider that St. <hi>John</hi> aſſiſted by the Spirit of God, did write his Goſpel on purpoſe to vindicate the Deity of our Saviour, which was denied by many Hereticks, he could not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally conclude otherwiſe, than that he was the Natural and Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Son of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Biſterfield</hi> againſt <hi>Crellius,</hi> gives this ſence of the controverted place, <hi>Do ye not read that I the</hi> Meſſias <hi>ſaid, ye are Gods,</hi> &amp;c.? If they that were, ſuch as they are deſcribed, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 82. ignorant, <hi>v.</hi> 2, <hi>&amp;c. Unjust, Oppreſſors, and ignorant Judges, were honoured with the Title of Gods, who yet muſt die like other Men, and the Scripture, which cannot lye, owns them for ſuch, how can ye ſay, that I who am ordained to be the Judge of the whole Earth, and ſtand in the midſt of the Congregations of ſuch Gods, as an Almighty, and Omniſcient Judge, to break in pieces, as with a Rod of Iron, all ſuch unrighteous Magiſtrates as oppoſe themſelves againſt me who
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59637:33"/> am ſanctified and appointed to be the Redeemer and Saviour of the World, that I blaſpheme in ſaying, I am the Son of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I inſiſt not on this, though it may have more of Argument in it than the <hi>Socinians</hi> can confute, it being ſaid in the cloſe of that <hi>Pſalm</hi> 82.8. <hi>Ariſe O God, judge thou the earth; for thou ſhalt take all the heathen for thy inheritance:</hi> which is very applicable to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
               <p>The Doctor ſeems to grant, <hi>That Chriſt was before he was ſanctified and ſent into the World. Crellius</hi> grants, <hi>That to ſanctifie, in Scripture, ſignifies to ſeparate one, and chooſe him for ſome ſingular Office, and to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him by ſpecial Gifts for the diſcharge of that Office; but this cannot be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed</hi> (ſays he) <hi>of him that is the moſt high God, ſuch Sanctification and Miſſion belongs to Chriſt only in reſpect of his humane Nature.</hi> To this <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterfield</hi> anſwers, <hi>That he muſt be a Stranger to the Scripture, that is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant who it was, and to what end Chriſt was ſent into the World, both which will prove his Godhead, not barely from his Miſſion, but his Miſſion to that end for which he was pre-ordained, which none could effect but he that was God; the Work was too great for any, or all the Angels of God, much more for any one Man; he therefore that was ſent to ſuch an end,</hi> (viz.) <hi>the Redemption of the World, and Satisfaction to the Divine Juſtice, muſt be more excellent than Men or Angels, or the Miſſion had been in vain;</hi> therefore, as <hi>St. Peter</hi> ſays, <hi>We were redeemed by the precious blood of the Son of God, and by nothing elſe as a meritorious cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt this, <hi>Crellius</hi> objects, from <hi>John</hi> 17.18. <hi>As thou (O Father) haſt ſent me into the World, even ſo I have ſent them (my Diſciples) into the World.</hi> And 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1. <hi>Many falſe Prophets are gone out into the World, but neither of theſe were in Heaven before they were ſent into the World, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither was Chriſt.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The word, As, doth not ſignifie a likeneſs in all reſpects, for then falſe Prophets, as he ſuppoſeth, (or elſe he urgeth the place to no purpoſe) were ſent to the ſame end as Chriſt and his Apoſtles; it ſignifies only ſome particular likeneſs in the Miſſion; for Chriſt was ſent by another, and for another end than the Apoſtles were; they were not ſent to redeem the World by ſuffering in the ſtead, and for the ſins of Men; but as Chriſt was ſent into the World to perform this ſingular Office, ſo were the Apoſtles ſent and qualified to do their Office, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to publiſh thoſe glad Tydings. Laſtly, Whereas <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> ſays, <hi>That this Sanctification cannot pertain to the Divine, but Humane Nature of Chriſt only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Anſwer is, That this Sanctification being the Pre-ordination of Chriſt to that great Office, of a Mediator between God and Man, for the Sanctification and Salvation of his People, he is ſaid to be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59637:33"/> 
                  <hi>(i. e.)</hi> as <hi>Crellius</hi> ſays, to be ſet apart and ordained by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that Office, or to ſanctify himſelf, by undertaking to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it, and to that end by his Divine he ſanctified his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the Sanctification of the Divine Nature was relative not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute or internal, as if any new Vertue or Divinity were added to it, but the Sanctification of the Humane Nature was the Union of it to the Divine Nature, in reſpect of both which Nature <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>t was qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for that Great End and Office of a Mediator; and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oth the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and Miſſion of our Saviour were but a Manifeſtation of his being qualified both as God and Man for that great End of our Redemption. If our Saviour's Sanctification and Miſſion into the World, were a ſufficient reaſon to convince the <hi>Jews</hi> that he was not a Blaſphemer, in ſaying that he was <hi>the Son of God,</hi> why may it not be a ſufficient Argument to prove that the <hi>Socinians</hi> blaſpheme Chriſt, who ſay he was not the Son of God, until his Conception and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into Heaven? Might not the <hi>Jews</hi> argue then as the <hi>Socinians</hi> now do, Why tell you us of your Sanctification and Miſſion, as if that made you the Son of God; if we could ſee you aſcend into the Heavens, we might believe that you came down from Heaven, but till then we muſt believe our eyes rather than your words; we ſee you are a Man, and know your Mother and Brethren, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you blaſpheme in ſaying, <hi>I am the Son of God.</hi> The truth is, that Chriſt's Sanctification or Unction, his Miſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were but as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of his Reſurrection, a Declaration only of what he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Again, the Queſtion was not in what reſpect he was the Son of God, but whether he was the Son of God, in any ſuch manner as might excuſe him by their Law from being a Blaſphemer? and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alſo he ſhews his Divine Wiſdom, he argues from his Works and from their Law, which they knew to convince them of what they were ignorant of, if he ſhould have proved that he was the Son of God, becauſe God was his Father by eternal Generation, that had been to prove <hi>ignotum per ignotius;</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> would have equally rejected both, and adjudged him guilty of Blaſphemy in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as not believing that God had a Son begotten of him from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or that Chriſt was this Son, but they having heard of a <hi>Meſſias,</hi> whom they expected about that time to come into the World, the beſt means to convince them that he who did the Works of God, which no Man could do except God were with him, was that <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias;</hi> and if that he was firſt ſanctified and then ſent into the World, in a more eminent manner, and for higher End, than any of thoſe to whom the Word of God came in former times, to commiſſionate
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59637:34"/> them as Magiſtrates for the Government of Mankind, then he did not blaſpheme in ſaying <hi>I am the Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>I am the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that if our Saviour's Argument were more oppoſite and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing than thoſe of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> we have gained this Fortreſs from them, and on their ſurrender of this, their other little Sconces will fall into our hands; for whatever is ſpoken of our Saviour as God, or the Son of God, they refer to his Deſignation and Miſſion into the World, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to his Humane Nature; as where it is ſaid, <hi>He received power from the Father; that he did the works of his Father; that he was one with the Father, by conſent of his will.</hi> And they will allow no ſuch Phraſes any way to imply his Deity, becauſe thoſe expreſſions of Gods gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Chriſt's receiving, God's ſending and his being ſent, imply a Superiority and Inferiority in the Perſons, and that the one recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſomewhat which he had not before: But the Fathers and late Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines do eaſily anſwer all theſe, thus, To the Objection of Receiving, 'tis ſaid, what Chriſt received of his Father, was not given as he was God, but Man. St. <hi>Ambroſe de Fide,</hi> l. 3. n. 22. <hi>Christ prayeth as the Son of Man, and obtains as the Son of God; he poſſeſſeth as the Son of God, what he prays for as the Son of Man: ſo he was anointed and grew in Grace,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not as God but Man.</hi> Perfecit non Deus ſed caro; <hi>So the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is greater than I, and the Father giveth life to the Son; and he received the Spirit without meaſure.</hi> All ſuch Phraſes belonging to Chriſt as Man, as Chriſt ſays of himſelf, <hi>All things are delivered to me of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> as he was then incarnate.</p>
               <p>The next moſt conſiderable Objection is from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, &amp;c. <hi>How Christ can be ſaid to be that true God, it being there ſaid he ſhall deliver up the kingdom to the Father, and then the Son himſelf ſhall be ſubject to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This doth not imply an Annulling or Abdication of his own Dominion as God, no more than when God the Father is ſaid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver all things to the Son, and <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. <hi>All power is given to me in heaven and earth;</hi> the Father did exclude himſelf by that Gift. 2ly, This Kingdom is peculiarly his Church: and St. <hi>Aug. de Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</hi> l. 1. c. 8. n. 60. thus explains that place, <hi>Tradere regnum eſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes perducere ad contemplationem Dei:</hi> To preſent his Church pure and without ſpot, free from all impurity of Fleſh and Spirit; from all Sins and all Enemies, which ſhall be trodden under their feet, as <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Phraſe is, <hi>Reddam te tibi meliorem;</hi> that whereas God was obeyed by them formerly but in part, now God ſhall be all in all.</p>
               <p>And when it is ſaid, <hi>Christ ſhall reign till he hath put all his enemies under his feet,</hi> it doth not imply that he ſhall reign no longer; but that he ſhall reign ſo long maugre all the Powers and Polity of the Gates of Hell, which ſhall not prevail againſt him; for the word <hi>until</hi> doth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59637:34"/> not exclude the future time; as <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.28. <hi>But how ſhall the Son himſelf then be ſubject? ſhall he become a ſubject of whoſe kingdom it was promiſed there ſhould be no end, and that he ſhould reign forever?</hi> Luke 1.33.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Chriſt while on Earth, and now in Heaven, is ſubject to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; What other Subjection can be conceived, Then when he ſhall deliver up the Kingdom?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This by the Ancients was underſtood of the myſtical Body of Chriſt, over which he is Head and King, and when the whole Church is ſubject, then Chriſt as the Head may be ſaid to be ſubject; ſo <hi>Athan. Contr. Apolon.</hi> n. 22. and St. <hi>Ambroſe de Fide,</hi> l. 5. c. 6. n. 24. <hi>Chriſt ſhall be ſubject in us who are not yet fully made ſubject.</hi> And St. <hi>Aug. Q.</hi> 93. 69. <hi>n.</hi> 87. it is ſpoken of Chriſt and his Members, <hi>Chriſtus u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſus eſt caput cum Membris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Subjection is ſpoken in the future Tenſe, <hi>Then ſhall the Son be ſubject.</hi> Now <hi>Gregory Nazian.</hi> asks the queſtion, <hi>Annon nunc eſt ſubjectus est?</hi> Orat. 36. Chriſt as Man never diſobeyed or rebelled, but we that are Members of his Miſtical Body do ſin and diſobey God and Chriſt; and till our mortal Body ſhall put on Immortality, we ſhall not be wholly brought into ſubjection; but when Chriſt ſhall have brought down all Authority and Power, ſubdued all his Enemies, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified all his Members, and preſents them to his Father, as his Church and his Body, then the Son is ſaid to be ſubject; not the Godhead of Chriſt, but the whole Church of Chriſt, which is the Head and Members, which then make one Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It is the Mediatorial Kingdom that ſhall be delivered up, not his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Kingdom; he ſhall reign in the one, till he hath ſubdued all his Enemies, but of the other there ſhall be no end.</p>

                  <hi>P.</hi> 27. <hi>c.</hi> 1. The Doctor reſtrains his Singularity of being <hi>the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God, to his being anointed before his coming into the World.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 26. <hi>c.</hi> 2. he ſays, <hi>That anointing was a Complement of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Kindneſs and Honor that could be beſtowed on a Gueſt; and from that Office in Feſtivals was preferred to a Ceremony for enſeating Kings, Prieſts, and Prophets; and our Lord by it is character'd but indefinitely, whether Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Prieſt, or King, or all.</hi> I perſwade myſelf that the Doctor learnt this from <hi>Crellius</hi> on <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.9. upon which he ſays, <hi>Our Saviour recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an immenſe meaſure of the Holy Ghoſt, (but not as the Scripture ſays, without meaſure) but ſome degrees more than what other Meſſengers of God received.</hi>

                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. is to ſhew, <hi>That it is no more neceſſary that we ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what the Perſon of Chriſt is, than for a Traveller to underſtand the Features of the Sun,</hi> &amp;c. Which he ſays concerning <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s calling
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59637:35"/> this Enquiry a <hi>Silly Queſtion,</hi> hath been already conſidered; to which he adds, <hi>That our Saviour could not require a belief of the whole truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Dignity of his Perſon, becauſe the Goſpel was preached to the Poor; And muſt they,</hi> ſays he, <hi>be excluded from the means of Redemption, becauſe they are excluded from the means of underſtanding the Myſteries of his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? Muſt they periſh for want of ſuch a belief as is morally impoſſible for them to acquire?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But is it morally impoſſible to believe what the Bleſſed Jeſus hath revealed of himſelf? Indeed if the Traveller ſhut his eyes, he may walk in the Dark, though the Sun ſhine clearly on him: And is the Traveller benefited only by the light of the Sun? doth he owe nothing to the comfortable influence of it? Or the Poor to whom the Goſpel belongs, are they only the Ignorant and Unbelievers? Chriſt tells us, <hi>That the poor to whom the kingdom of heaven belongs, are the poor in ſpirit;</hi> ſuch are ſenſible that they are naturally blind, and miſerable, and poor, and naked, not ſuch as are rich and increaſed in Goods, and have need of nothing, as the <hi>Laodiceans, Revel.</hi> 4.17. This is the Doctor's <hi>Pelagian</hi> ſence, which hath led him into other groſs Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. The Poor in the Goſpel are ſuch as can ſubmit their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to the Revelations of God; and though with the Bleſſed Virgin they doubt a while how theſe things can be true, yet they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them to be true, on the Revelation; and this is that Humility and Lowlineſs for which ſhe is commended; and this is the Power of the Goſpel, <hi>which is mighty through God to caſt down the ſtrongholds and imaginations of every one that exalts himſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and brings into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>Is it not neceſſary we ſhould know him in whom we believe? Then is not the knowledge of God neceſſary? Is it not neceſſary to know him, on the knowledge of whom our Hope and Belief of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life is founded? Then it is not neceſſary to know, whether CHRIST or <hi>Mahomet</hi> were an Impoſtor, and if <hi>Mahomet</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered as good Natural or Moral Precepts as our Saviour hath done; we may make him the Object of our Faith, and expect Eternal Life by <hi>Mahomet</hi> as well as by Chriſt: Therefore doubtleſs it is neceſſary to believe of Chriſt as St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas</hi> did, <hi>That he is the Son of the living God;</hi> our Lord and our God, which Fleſh and Blood hath not revealed to us; and on which Faith Chriſt hath promiſed to build his Church. They who ſaw his Miracles, and heard his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, confeſſed that God was with him: but in the Confeſſions of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> there was ſomething extraordinary which they believed of the Perſon of Chriſt.</p>

                  <hi>P.</hi> 32. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>Two Evangeliſts,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>trace our Lord's Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, but as they derive it not from his real but ſuppoſed Father, ſo they take two ſeveral ways, not to ſatsfie but amuſe us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The deſign of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> was, to ſhew that Chriſt deſcended from <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s being of that Tribe, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Juda,</hi> being the natural Son of <hi>Jacob;</hi> to which it is objected, <hi>That though</hi> Joſeph, <hi>more of that Tribe, yet Chriſt could not be ſo by deſcent from</hi> Joſeph, <hi>who was not his natural Father; and by the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>he could not be of the ſeed of</hi> David, <hi>ſhe being of the Tribe of</hi> Levi, <hi>and not of</hi> Juda. <hi>Voſſius</hi> recites the Opinion of ſome Ancients, who thought it was enough to entitle <hi>Mary</hi> to the Tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi> becauſe ſhe married into that Tribe; therefore he proves <hi>Mary</hi> to be of the ſame Tribe with <hi>Joſeph,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Numb.</hi> 36.6. <hi>It was not lawful for a Virgin to marry out of her own Tribe.</hi> Nor would <hi>Joſeph,</hi> being a juſt Man, have taken one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tribe; and this practiſe of marrying in the ſame Tribe, was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially obſerved where the Virgin was an Heireſs, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance might be kept not only in the Tribe, but the Family; and therefore they uſually married the next of kin; the Virgin there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having no Brother, was married to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was of near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity with her.<note place="margin">See Voſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us's Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogy.</note> And he proves the ſame Deſcent of the Bleſſed Virgin from St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Genealogy, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>David;</hi> to which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Reader.</p>
               <p>But if it he queſtioned, why if <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> had been both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from <hi>David,</hi> why St. <hi>Matthew</hi> had not named <hi>Mary</hi> rather than <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was only a ſuppoſed Father? To this he anſwers, 1. <hi>Becauſe the Husband was not to be bard of his Honour.</hi> 2. <hi>It was not the Cuſtom of the</hi> Jews <hi>to derive the Genealogy from the Woman; and the Kinred of</hi> Joſeph <hi>and</hi> Mary <hi>being well known, there was no neceſſity of mentioning it among the</hi> Jews, <hi>which dwelt in</hi> Paleſtine, <hi>to whom the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt wrote.</hi> And they were very curious in preſerving their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies: and it would much have prejudiced St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Goſpel, if undertaking to prove the Deſcent of Chriſt from <hi>David,</hi> he ſhould have failed in that chief deſign, and in the beginning of the Book: and doubtleſs the <hi>Jews</hi> who were living at that time when he wrote, which was about forty Years after our Lord's Nativity, had their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy preſerved, and probably ſome of our Lord's Kinred then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and they having ſeen his Miracles, by which they were induced to believe him to be the Son of God, knew alſo that he deſcended of <hi>David,</hi> according to the Fleſh, as the Goſpel teacheth; and there was no Objection made to the contrary, by <hi>Jews</hi> or the <hi>Phari<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:59637:36"/> the contrary whereof if they could have proved, it would have been their firſt and beſt Argument againſt our Saviour.</p>
               <p>Now it is a prophane thing to think, that the Evangeliſts did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to prove what they were not able to perform, and that they ſhould be guilty of ſuch an Error, as the Doctor imputes to them, in the beginning of their Goſpels, to amuſe us with Uncertainties, and ſo draw an invincible Prejudice upon their Goſpels.</p>
               <p>That the whole Myſtery of the Incarnation ſhould be underſtood, was not neceſſary, but that it ſhould be believed was ſo; and this was not impoſſible to the Poor, except upon the <hi>Socinian</hi> grounds, viz. <hi>That we cannot believe what our reaſon cannot comprehend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The belief of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> on the Meſſage of the Angel, That ſhe ſhould conceive a Son that ſhould be called, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> be the Son of God; for which the Angel pronounceth her Bleſſed. The belief of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> of <hi>Martha,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> who believed Chriſt to be the Son of God, do ſhew that ſuch a belief was not impoſſible, though they underſtood not the whole Myſtery of the Incarnation: the Bleſſed Virgin did queſtion, <hi>How ſhall this be?</hi> Luke 1.34. ſhe could not conceive the manner, but believed the Meſſage; and v. 45. <hi>Bleſſed is ſhe that believeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He quotes <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> in his Dialogue with <hi>Triphon</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> p. 31. <hi>c.</hi> 1. in theſe words, <hi>Though I ſhall not prove, that Chriſt is God, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than by proving, that this is the Chriſt, and that it was foretold that Chriſt ſhould be ſuch,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>by the Harmony of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. Yet there are ſome among us (my Friends) who profeſs him to be the Chriſt, and affirm him to be a Man born of Men; with whom indeed I do not agree, nor will many ſpeak ſo, who are of the ſame Opinion with me. By which words it is plain</hi> (ſaith the Doctor) <hi>that however the belief of Chriſt's Godhead was then moſt generally received, yet were not the otherwiſe mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed excluded from the benefit of his Redemption as Unbelievers.</hi> How this Concluſion can be inferred from his ſaying, that he doth not agree with ſuch, is not ſo plain to me; the right Inference from theſe words of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> is, That the Godhead of Chriſt was generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his Age. What he adds, <hi>That the Controverſy hath gotten a new value, not from any new intrinſick Worth, but from the Price which it hath coſt,</hi> is an invidious Reflection on the Orthodox Chriſtians, who were on the defenſive Part, being, as he grants, in poſſeſſion, and in all Ages ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered more vexation and cruelty from the <hi>Arians, Donatiſts,</hi> and other Sectaries that joyned with them, than from their Heathen Perſecutors, whom yet the Doctor would accuſe as the Authors of all that Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Bloodſhed, occaſioned by the Hereſies and Diviſions of the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts.</hi>

Such a rambling inconſiſtent Evidence as this, is enough to draw a Prejudice againſt all the reſt: I have not all the Records whereby to examine the other Witneſſes which he doth produce to prove <hi>Conſtantine</hi> an <hi>Arian: Oroſius</hi> whom he quotes, ſays nothing of it. <hi>Sulpitius Severus,</hi> l. 2. p. 138. ſays, <hi>That by the two</hi> Arius's, <hi>the great Authors of the</hi> Arian <hi>Perfidy, the Emperor was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and thinking to do a religious Office, he became a Perſecutor; he ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Biſhops, delt ſeverely with the Clergy and Laity that departed from the Communion of the</hi> Arians. Now this being the firſt particular which this Witneſs mentioneth of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and for remedy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he ſays, the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council was called, cannot be underſtood of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s ſetled Judgment, or conſtant Practice, which is otherwiſe related by other Authentick Hiſtorians, and by himſelf, who ſays af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, that the Emperor embraced the Decrees of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59637:37"/> which condemned the <hi>Arians,</hi> who thereby were calmed and joyned in Communion with the Catholicks. So that neither is this Witneſs conſiſtent with himſelf, for he was a profeſt Enemy to the <hi>Arians, Who</hi> (he ſays) <hi>not being able to overthrow the Faith by Argument, ſought to deſtroy the Champions of it by ſuborning falſe Accuſers, and fein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faults where they could find none;</hi> of which he gives Inſtances.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly, That <hi>Optatus</hi> calls <hi>Conſtantine</hi> an Apoſtate, he only ſays, but quotes not the place, which is ſo much for his Cauſe, that I believe he would not have omitted it, if it were really ſo, for it would have weighed much more than that rabble of Quotations which he col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, as ſo many St. <hi>Omers</hi> Evidences, ſuch as <hi>Philoſtorgius</hi> and his <hi>Rhemenſes,</hi> and his <hi>Anonymous Authors;</hi> what <hi>Socrates, Sozom.

The Doctor amuſeth us with the variety of Creeds publiſhed by Councils, under the influence of the Emperor <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> whereof I ſhall give the Reader this brief account. After that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> fell under <hi>Conſtantines</hi> diſpleaſure, and was baniſhed, it is ſaid, <hi>he never ſaw his face more;</hi> though it is reported, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did it out of kindneſs to ſecure him from the Attempts of ſuch as ſought to take away his life; and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> his Son declared as much, and that it was his Fathers mind to recal him; and ſome ſay he would have
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59637:38"/> put it on his Will, had not <hi>Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> hindred it. <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> himſelf was of the ſame mind; and evident it is, that his Son <hi>Conſtantine</hi> recalled him ſoon after his Fathers death, and ſent Letters to the people of <hi>Alexandria</hi> on his behalf. A Synod at <hi>Alexandria</hi> vindicate him, and write to <hi>Julius</hi> Bp of <hi>Rome</hi> on his behalf; but a Synod being met at <hi>Antioch,</hi> which had the favour of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> they coyn new Creeds in oppoſition to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith; there are in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory fower ſorts, one is of a larger ſize, which hath this Preface, <hi>We are not the diſciples of</hi> Arius; yet they conſented to the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who made his Appeal to <hi>Julius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who ſummoned the Eaſtern Biſhops, intending a hearing of <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> his cauſe in a full Synod; but they refuſing to come, the Synod acquitted <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and condemned <hi>Photinus. Conſtans</hi> befriended <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſo far, as to write to his Brother <hi>Conſtantius</hi> on his behalf, not without threatning to reſtore him by Arms, if it were denyed. They therefore agreed that there ſhould be a general Council ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at <hi>Millan,</hi> but that requiring a long time, there was a Synod held at <hi>Sardica,</hi> where the <hi>Arrian</hi> Party thought that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> durſt not appear; but he deceived them, and came ſo provided, that they thought not fit to revive their accuſations againſt him; though a Party of the <hi>Arrians</hi> decreed to omit the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and without hearing, condemned <hi>Julius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome, Hoſius</hi> of <hi>Corduba,</hi> and <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius.</hi> But the Council of <hi>Sardica</hi> confirmed the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith, acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and found the <hi>Arrian</hi> Party guilty of divers Tumults, which had occaſioned much ſhedding of blood; they Condemned <hi>George,</hi> who had intruded to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not worthy of the name of a Chriſtian; and wrote their Letters to <hi>Julius,</hi> to confirm their Decree for the reſtoring of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> which was agreed to by more than Three Hundred Biſhops; and ſent Letters alſo to the people of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to receive their Biſhop; and it hapning that <hi>George</hi> the Intruder, having been ſlain in a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, <hi>Conſtantius</hi> himſelf fearing the conſequence of ſuch Tumults, wrote to the Citizens on the behalf of <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> And thus that Church injoyed ſome reſpite, <hi>Conſtantius</hi> being employed in a War againſt <hi>Magnentius.</hi> In his March towards <hi>Murſa,</hi> where the Battle was fought, he made a ſtop at a Church under the Jurisdiction of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi> the <hi>Arrian</hi> Biſhop, waiting the Succeſs of the Battle; in which retirement <hi>Valens</hi> careſt the Emperor, and as <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> relates the matter, <hi>Valens</hi> had provided ſome Meſſengers to attend the Army, and as ſoon as they ſaw to which Party the Victory inclined, to bring him the News with all poſſible ſpeed, deſigning that if the Emperour was overcome, he might ſecure himſelf by flight; if he conquered,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59637:39"/> 
                  <hi>Valens</hi> might ingratiate himſelf, by giving the firſt Intelligence of a Victory, which accordingly fell out; for <hi>Magentius</hi> was totally rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the News came when the Emperour ſeemed much dejected; but on hearing of it by <hi>Valence,</hi> the Emperour could ſcarce believe it, demanding to ſpeak with the Meſſenger: but <hi>Valens</hi> told him, <hi>He might be confident of it, for it was revealed to him by an Angel:</hi> and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Meſſenger entred to confirm the News of the Victory. This ſo ingratiated <hi>Valens</hi> with the Emperour, that he was wont to ſay, The Victory was owing more to the Merits of <hi>Valens,</hi> than to the Valour of his Army. <hi>Sulp.

               <p>After this Battel, <hi>Valens</hi> having regain'd the good Opinion of the Emperour, which he had almoſt loſt by his inconſtancy, declaring ſometimes for, and other times againſt the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith. And now was a fit opportunity to mind the Emperour of his Promiſe for Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning a General Council at <hi>Millan,</hi> the Emperour being then reſident there; and the Council being met, <hi>Valens</hi> purſues his deſign againſt <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> requiring Subſcriptions for his Condemnation; but the Orthodox Party perceiving many <hi>Arians</hi> there, deſired that Matters of Faith might have the precedency, and ſo propounded the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed to be firſt ſubſcribed; which <hi>Valens</hi> oppoſing, it was caſt in his teeth, <hi>That he had formerly ſubſcribed it more than once, and therefore it was hoped he would not refuſe it now:</hi> yet when <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> took his Pen ready to ſubſcribe his Name, <hi>Valens</hi> ſnatcht it out of his hand, and bid him, <hi>forbear, until</hi> Athanaſius<hi>'s Caſe was decided;</hi> and then was an <hi>Arian</hi> Creed read, and Subſcriptions required there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; which the Catholiks refuſed, and thereupon aroſe a great Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult among the People; inſomuch, that the Emperour fearing the event, adjourned them to meet at his Court, where the Accuſations againſt <hi>Athanaſius</hi> being renewed, the Catholicks pleaded, that they had been adjudged to be falſe, <hi>(viz.)</hi> in the Synod at <hi>Tyre, Anno</hi> 335, where the Woman that was brought to accuſe him for Incontinency, was convicted of a falſe Accuſation; for <hi>Timotheus</hi> who accompanied <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> ſtood up, as if he had been <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and asked her, <hi>Whether he ever uſed any force or other temptation to deprave her?</hi> which ſhe confidently affirmed; and thereupon that ſham was detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>So was the Second Accuſation about the Death of <hi>Arſenius,</hi> who being deprived by <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and denied Communion with the Church at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the <hi>Arian</hi> Party perſwaded him to withdraw, and lie hid for a while; and in the mean time they gave out, that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> had been the cauſe of deſtroying him: but there were two
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59637:39"/> ſufficient Witneſſes produced to prove, that <hi>Arſenius</hi> was alive, and that they ſaw him lately in good health.</p>
               <p>They accuſed him alſo of ſeveral other Crimes, but wanting ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Evidence, the Emperour being preſent, ſtood up and ſaid, <hi>That he himſelf accuſed</hi> Athanaſius, <hi>and knew him to be a turbulent and ſeditious Perſon, and demanded who would refuſe his Teſtimony. Liberius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was the firſt whoſe Subſcription to the Condemnation of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was required, who ſtoutly refuſed it, and argued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Emperour, and others who urged it, and ſtill refuſing was baniſhed by the Emperour; then <hi>Hoſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Corduba</hi> was aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſometime by Promiſes, and then by Threats, and being of great Age, and overcome by Reproaches, as if he alone withſtood the Emperour's Pleaſure, and the Church's Peace, and having ſuffered in his Body, as well as his good Name, at laſt, to ſave his Carcaſe, (as the Hiſtorians ſay) was prevailed with to ſubſcribe; but return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home to <hi>Spain, Athanaſius</hi> ſays, that <hi>Hoſius</hi> on his Death-bed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, complaining of the Violences which were offered him, and anathematized the <hi>Arians,</hi> charging all the People to avoid that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> gives him an excellent Character, and in alluſion to his Name, ſays, <hi>He was truly</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Another Synod was made up by ſome of theſe Men at <hi>Sirmium,</hi> where they condemned as well the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, as being not Scriptural words; and 'tis obſerved, that in their addreſs to the Emperour, among other Titles which they gave him, they termed him <hi>Eternal,</hi> which they denied to grant to the Son of God, whom they affirmed to be a Creature. This Synod was held <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 359.</p>
               <p>But there needed yet a farther Confirmation of the <hi>Arian</hi> Doctrine, and therefore the Emperour is perſwaded to ſend to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſummon all the Biſhops of the <hi>Latine,</hi> as the Emperour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook for the Biſhops of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church; and there was like to be ſo great a concourſe, that one place was not thought capable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them; wherefore <hi>Ariminum</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> was appointed for the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern,</hi> and <hi>Selucia</hi> for the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Biſhops. Here <hi>Valens</hi> finding the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith likely to be confirmed, read a Creed very like to that of the <hi>Nicene,</hi> one only expreſſion being ſubtily inſerted, <hi>(viz.)

                  <hi>Thracia,</hi> where they confirmed the ſame Faith, thinking to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to the common People under the name of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith.

                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. He ſays, <hi>The Diſpute is dangerous, and the Danger is twofold,</hi> 1. <hi>Of Blaſphemy.</hi> 2. <hi>Contention.</hi> 1. <hi>Concerning Blaſphemy: They who held the</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>were thought to blaſpheme, as denying that the Son had any ſubſtance of his own: The others were accuſed as Heathen that brought in the Worſhip of many Gods. And thus,</hi> he ſays, <hi>either Party charged the other with Blaſphemy.</hi> As for the <hi>Arians,</hi> it may well be thought that they had their ſuperior and inferior Gods, in that they worſhipped a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted God; but the <hi>Conſubſtantialiſts</hi> worſhipped one God only, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the Trinity in Unity.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt a Blaſphemy againſt the Son of God, when as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> that would have ſtoned him becauſe he ſaid he was the Son of God, thinking that he acted by the help of <hi>Belzeebub</hi> the Prince of Devils, and if they had only denied him to have wrought his Miracles by the Spirit of God, this had been a Blaſpemy. An ancient Divine of our Church, Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> writing of the Incarnation of our Saviour, gives his ſence of <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.31, 32. which I only repeat, and leave the Reader to judge of it, being alien from the common Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi rend="margSglQuotes">Chriſt having caſt out a Devil by his Divine Spirit, the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> knowing it muſt be done by ſome ſupernatural Power, would not grant it to be by the Power of God, but of the Devil; our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour convinceth them that it was done by the Spirit of God, tho' they would not acknowledge it, but againſt the Evidence of a Divine Power, blaſphemed the Spirit by which our Saviour had done that Miracle.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:59637:40"/>
               <p>They had reproached him as a Man before, calling him <hi>a glutton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſon, a Wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and Sinners:</hi> This was <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſius ventire de felio hominis.</hi> But when they blaſpheme the Spirit of God by which he had caſt out a Devil, as if by conſent of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils he had caſt them out: this he denounceth an unpardonable Sin, the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Against the ſpirit of God in Christ, not taken perſonally, for the Holy Ghost, but eſſentially for the Godhead of Christ:</hi> for which he quotes St. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaying, <hi>Spiritus appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio est Communis tribus perſonis.</hi> And <hi>Tertul. Jeſus Chriſtus est Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus dei.</hi> St. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> alſo, <hi>Quia deus Spiritus eſt poteſt dici Pater eſt Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, filius eſt ſpiritus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſays the <hi>Phariſees</hi> had not heard of the Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt, of which ſome of the Diſciples were not fully inſtructed: The Queſtion was, Whether Chriſt acted by the Spirit and Power of God, or the Devil? And Chriſt proves he did it by the Spirit, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> by the Power of the Godhead.</p>
               <p>The ſence then of our Saviour's Anſwer, to make it pertinent to the Objection, is this; What I have now done, I have proved to be done by the Spirit of God; and though what you have ſpoken againſt me as the Son of Man, may be forgiven, yet what you, or any other ſhall ſpeak againſt me as the Son of God, ſhall never be forgiven. Therefore he concludes, that to deny the Deity of Chriſt, is that Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy; for to rob Chriſt of his Godhead, which is the foundation of the Remiſſion of Sins, is to exclude ourſelves from that benefit, <hi>Qui negat deum in Chriſto caret omni Miſericordia;</hi> He that denies Chriſt to be God, cannot obtain mercy.</p>
               <p>Hence the Fathers affirm, <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> who denyed the Deity of Chriſt, to be guilty of the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, 2 St. <hi>John</hi> 4.3. <hi>Every ſpirit or doctrine; Qui ſoluit Jeſum.</hi> (So St. <hi>Heirom Proſp.</hi> &amp;c. read that Text) That divides the Deity of Chriſt from his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, is Antichriſt, St. <hi>Ambroſe de Fide.</hi> And he is Antichriſt that denyeth the Father and the Son, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.22.</p>
               <p>He adds, <hi>It is dangerous becauſe we have no firm footing from Scripture, Antiquity, or Councils.</hi> Which becauſe he only affirms, without ſhew of proof, it will be ſufficient to deny. And though this Poſition were raſh enough, yet what he adds is much worſe, viz. <hi>That the</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſian <hi>may be numbered among the</hi> Roman <hi>Doctrines, and to be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veled with the</hi> Arian, <hi>equally unworthy of not only our Faith but our Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Doctrine is not only agreeable to the <hi>Nicene,</hi> but they are both retained in the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and how can he affirm himſelf a Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59637:41"/> bids ſuch an open Defiance to the Doctrine of that Church? The <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> Council grounded their Decrees on the Scripture, as they had been underſtood by the Primitive and Apoſtolical Fathers, before there was either Imperial or Papal Power in the Chriſtian Church: and it is very ſtrange, if this be not a more firm Foundation, than his corrupt Reaſon, when it is contrary both to Scripture, Antiquity, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and the ſence of the Catholick Church in all Ages, as much as to the Faith of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Chapter the Doctor tells us of the Council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> which was many Years after that of <hi>Nice,</hi> and was the greateſt for number that ever was, but one of the worſt (for the major part were <hi>Arians;</hi>) the Doctor confeſſing, <hi>p.</hi> 38. <hi>col.</hi> 2. <hi>That the</hi> Arians <hi>had all the Eaſtern Churches, except that of</hi> Hieruſalem; <hi>that in this Council the Latine Church were circumvented by the Greeks, who when it was propoſed by the Greeks, Whether they would worſhip Chriſt, or <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>but in Chriſt.</hi> Before I anſwer this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhall add another which the Doctor urgeth, <hi>p.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 1. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Conſubſtantiality, he ſays, <hi>It was a Myſtery to thoſe very Councils which determined it; and as it appears,</hi> ſays he, <hi>by thoſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Determinations of ſeveral Councils, and by the wavering of the ſame Council; for that of</hi> Sermium <hi>framed two or three, one whereof they would have reneg'd and laboured to recal its Copies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Variety of Councils was occaſioned partly by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Arian</hi> Emperors, under whom at that time St. <hi>Hierome</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the whole World became <hi>Arians,</hi> but more eſpecially by ſubtilty of thoſe <hi>Greeks,</hi> of whom he ſpeaks, who pleaded the Cauſe of the <hi>Arians</hi> in that Council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> againſt the <hi>Latine</hi> Church; for thoſe ſort of <hi>Greeks</hi> were poſſeſt of the Eaſtern Churches, as our Doctor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. But the <hi>Latine</hi> Church adhered to the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> and <hi>Nicene</hi> Creeds; and as Ignorant as the Doctor accounts them, they diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and baffled the Sophiſtry of his ſubtile <hi>Greeks,</hi> even in that Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theirs, That <hi>they believed not in the</hi>

                  </gap> as ſome of thoſe ſubtile <hi>Greeks</hi> would have impoſed on them, contrary to the Opinion they had of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now this piece of Sophiſtry will thus appear: <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſpeaking of ſome Hereticks, who uſed the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, ſays, That <hi>Paulus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſ. uſed it in a ſence that might confirm his Error, and deſtroy the true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Word.</hi> The Council of <hi>Nice</hi> agreed the meaning of it to be, That the Son had a proper Perſonality which made him the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, but was of the Subſtance with the Father. And <hi>Socrates,</hi> l. 1. c. 8. ſays, <hi>They held the Son to be of the Father, but not as a part of his Subſtance;</hi> (which was the Error of <hi>Paulus Samoſ.

                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:59637:41"/> &amp;c.) <hi>declaring the Divine Eſſence to be undivided; contrary to the Opinion of thoſe Hereticks, that held the Divine Subſtance to be divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and the Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in this ſence they uſed the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> accounted Heretical: this was known to the <hi>Latine</hi> Church, and when they propoſed that word in a ſence oppoſite to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith, they did (as they had juſt cauſe) reject it, and anſwered that ſubtile Queſtion with a plain renouncing of the Error of thoſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks that thought to impoſe their ſence on them, <hi>We will not worſhip</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In this ſence it was that the Fathers in that Council renounced the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I ſhall here once for all give my Reader a ſhort Account of the Controverſy between St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and <hi>Arius: Alexander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> having heard of the Blaſphemy of <hi>Arius,</hi> a Prieſt under his Juriſdiction, called a Synod of his Province, to enquire into his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and cenſure him: <hi>Arius</hi> appeared and maintained, <hi>That there was a time when Chriſt was not; that he was</hi> Deus Factus, <hi>made a God, and ſo a Creature.</hi> For theſe and other Heretical Opinions, he was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, together with ſome others, whom he had drawn to his Opinion; and by their means the People were alſo divided, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hold Communion with each other.</p>
               <p>The Emperor being informed how far the Diſſention ſpread, and what Tumults had been already occaſioned by the Controverſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Arians,</hi> though not fully informed of the truth of the Queſtion, made it his buſineſs to apply a ſeaſonable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to ſo great an Evil; and firſt he ſent Letters by <hi>Hoſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Corduba,</hi> both to <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Arius,</hi> enjoyning them to Peace and Brotherly Communion: <hi rend="margSglQuotes">I find, <hi>ſaith the Emperor,</hi> that the riſe of the Controverſy between you is this: That when you <hi>Alexander,</hi> required of your Presbyters what they thought of a certain place in the Law, or rather of a needleſs Queſtion; and you <hi>Arius</hi> did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently reply, what you neither ought to think, nor being thought, you ought to have ſuppreſt by ſilence; the Diſcord between you cauſed a breach in your Communion, whereby the People alſo were divided from the Unity of the Church: wherefore I Exhort, that each of you pardoning each other, do embrace what I your Fellow-Servant moſt juſtly require: for it was neither fit to move ſuch a Queſtion at firſt, nor being moved to return ſuch an Anſwer to it; for ſuch Queſtions which no neceſſity of the Law doth preſcribe,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59637:42"/> ought to be kept in our own Breaſts, and not to be unadviſedly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Ears of the Vulgar, leſt we for the infirmity of our Nature, not being able to explain what is propoſed, and the People through their dulneſs being not able to apprehend it, they neceſſarily fall into Blaſphemy or Schiſm, for the Contention is not about any great Command of the Law, nor is there any new Opinion ſtarted concerning the Worſhip of God, but you both retain one and the ſame Opinion, <hi>(ſo it ſeems the Emperour was informed)</hi> and therefore may well live in the ſame Communion, as the various Sect of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers do. Let us duly conſider how unequal it is, that by your Contention about light and vain words, the People that lived as Brethren, ſhould be divided as Enemies, by your ſtrife about ſmall and unneceſſary things: Theſe Actions are more agreeable to the Ignorance of Boys, than to the Wiſdom of Prieſts, and wiſe Men; but ſeeing you have the ſame Faith, and the ſame Opinion of our Religion, and our Law requires concord of Minds, and the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie between you doth not concern the Subſtance of Religion, there ought not to be any diſcord between you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This he ſaid before he had been duly informed of the State of the Controverſie; what his thoughts were afterward, you ſhall hear anon.</p>
               <p>But as <hi>Socrat. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 8. ſays, neither the Emperours Letters, nor the Endeavours of <hi>Hoſius,</hi> could compoſe the Diſſention; the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour therefore reſolved to ſummon a General Council at <hi>Nice,</hi> in <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinia,</hi> to which all the Biſhops of <hi>Europe, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and there met above 300 Biſhops, beſides Presbyters, Deacons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> many of whom were eminent for Wiſdom in Speaking, Holineſs of Life, Patience in Suffering, Modeſty and Meekneſs of Manners; theſe being aſſembled, the Emperour appears, the Biſhops having done their Reverence, he ſate not down himſelf, until he had beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them to ſit down; and he ſpake firſt, exhorting them to Peace and Unity; and whereas they had accuſed one another in ſeveral Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels the day before, he injoyn'd them to burn thoſe Libels, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give each other, as they expected Chriſt ſhould forgive them: Then he gave them leave to propoſe the Differences that concern'd Religion, of which <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the Third Book of the Life of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> gives this Account, <hi>That many things being propoſed by both Parties, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour attended with great patience and intention of mind, weighing what was offered by both Parties, moderating and allaying their heats, and by his own arguments convincing ſome, and perſwading others, they were at laſt brought to an agreement;</hi> which was committed to Writing. Some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars whereof, ſaith <hi>Socrates,</hi> l. 1. c. 8. I will repeat, leaſt any ſhould
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59637:42"/> condemn the Proceedings of that Council, or as <hi>Sabinus</hi> did, account them ignorant and ſimple Men, as particularly he did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who ſubſcribed not until he had ſtrictly examined the Controverſie; however he commends the Emperour, as being very skilful in the Matters of Faith. <hi>Socrates</hi> alſo commends <hi>Euſebius Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyli</hi> as a faithful Witneſs of what was done in that Council.</p>
               <p>The Faith then agreed on was drawn into the Form which is now in our Liturgy, to which they added an Anathema againſt ſuch as ſhould affirm, <hi>That there was a time when the Son of God was not; and that was made of things that were not, or that he had ſome other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or Eſſence created, or ſubject to change.</hi> To this 318 Biſhops ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, five only refuſed, becauſe of the word Conſubſtantial, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Theognis</hi> afterward recanted, and were reconciled; the reſt kept in Baniſhment with <hi>Arius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Euſebius</hi> having after long deliberation aſſented to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, ſends a Copy of it to his People of <hi>Caeſarca,</hi> with a particular Account how it was examined; and tells his People, That it was the ſame which he had received from the Biſhops his Predeceſſors, when he was firſt inſtructed by them, and which they profeſſed at their Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, and which he would defend with his Life; he tells them, the Emperour confirm'd it firſt, with the addition of the word <hi>Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial,</hi> to which they all agreed. And to remove the prejudices which his People might have conceiv'd againſt him, for ſtanding out ſo long, till he was ſentenced to Baniſhment, and then conforming, he tells them, with how great Judgment he conſidered both the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his Diſſent, and of his Conſent, ſuſpending his Aſſent from the firſt to the laſt; however, as long as he met with any thing that offended him; but when after due examination he found the ſence of the words controverted to agree with that Faith which he at firſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he embraced them. And what thoſe were, he gives a particular Account, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe words were examined, <hi>Of the Subſtance of the Father:</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which there aroſe divers Queſtions and Anſwers; and after Examination it was agreed, That the words of the Subſtance ſignified, <hi>That the Son was of the Father, but not as a part of the Father:</hi> to this I conſented, as alſo to the word <hi>Conſubſtantial,</hi> for the ſake of Peace: and that I might not fall from the right underſtanding of it, in like manner to the words, <hi>Begotten not made;</hi> becauſe it was urged, that the word <hi>made</hi> was common to the Creatures which were made by the Son, to which he had no likeneſs, being of a more excellent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which the Scripture teach was of the Father, by a ſecret man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Generation not to be expreſſed; and this Conſubſtantiality
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59637:43"/> was not to be in a corporeal manner, as in mortal Creatures; for it was not by diviſion of Subſtance, nor Abſciſſion, nor change of the Father's Subſtance and Power, becauſe this was different from all thoſe; but it ſignifies that the Son had no likeneſs with the Creatures that were made by him, but was in all things like to the Father, by whom he was begotten, and of no other Subſtance; and to this we conſented, knowing that many ancient famous Biſhops and learned Writers, ſpeaking of the Divinity of the Father and the Son, uſed the ſame word. The Emperour alſo expreſſed the ſame ſence of the word <hi>Conſubſtantial,</hi> which he ſaid, <hi>Was not to be underſtood, as if the Son were of the Father by Diviſion, or any Section, as in corporeal Subſtances, becauſe an intellectual and immaterial Nature admits not of the Affections of Bodies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that you may know ſomething of the Hiſtory of <hi>Arius,</hi> I ſhall give you this brief Account.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="margSglQuotes">God was not alway a Father; the Word of God was not alway, but had its beginning of nothing; for God which is, created him that was not, out of that which was not; and ſo the Son, they ſay, is a Creature, not like his Father in Subſtance, nor the True Word of God, nor his True Wiſdom; but one of his Works and Creatures, but abuſively ſo called, being made by the Word and Wiſdom which is in God, that made him and all things: That the Son knows not the Father, nor can perfectly know him; nor doth he know his own Subſtance what it is; but was made as an Inſtrument by which God would create us; nor had he been made, unleſs God would have made us by him. To them that ask, whether the Word of God could be changed as the Devil was, they anſwer, Yea, that he is of a mutable Nature, becauſe he was created. <hi>Arius</hi> with great impudence affirming theſe Things, We, together, with almoſt an hundred Biſhops of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Lybia,</hi> did anathematize him and his Adherents; but <hi>Euſebius</hi> hath received them, that he may joyn Impiety to Piety, Falſhood to Truth; but they ſhall not prevail, for Truth will overcome: for whoever heretofore heard ſuch things, or now hearing them, doth not ſtop his Ears, who hearing St. <hi>John</hi> ſay, <hi>In the beginning was the Word,</hi> will not condemn theſe Mens ſayings, <hi>There was a time when he was not,</hi> &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Letters had various effects on a great many, and not much to the advantage of <hi>Alexander,</hi> for <hi>Arius</hi> and his Party were very diligent in writing on the contrary behalf; <hi>Euſebius</hi> alſo Biſhop of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedia</hi> heartily eſpouſed his Cauſe, partly out of a private grudge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and Biſhop <hi>Alexander,</hi> and partly through his own Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which agreed with thoſe of <hi>Arius,</hi> and the Emperour being then at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> with whom he was in favour, and by this opportunity he had great influence on the neighbouring Biſhops, to whom he wrote divers Letters on the behalf of <hi>Arius;</hi> he wrote alſo to <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf, admoniſhing him to receive <hi>Arius</hi> again into his Communion; and by theſe means the Diviſions were ſo great, that not only the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, but the People alſo ran into Parties; and the <hi>Meletians</hi> alſo joyned with <hi>Arius;</hi> ſo that they wrote to <hi>Alexander</hi> to recall the Excommunication againſt him, pleading, that his Opinions were right; for <hi>Arius</hi> did ſo palliate his Hereſie, as that to the unwary and more ignorant ſort, both of Clergy and People, it
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59637:44"/> ſeemed nothing different from the Orthodox Doctrine.</p>
               <p>The Emperor alſo wrote to a contrary purpoſe to the Church of <hi>Alexandria, Socrates</hi> p 30. <hi>That all things concerning the Controverſies that were moved, had been acurately diſcuſſed and examined by the Council. But O! what great and grievous Blaſphemies ſome did declare against our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour! and our Hope of Eternal Life! producing things contrary to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture inſpired from above, and to the Faith, yet profeſſing their belief of them; whereas therefore more than</hi> 300 <hi>Biſhops, which were to be admired for their modeſty and diligence, conformed by their unanimous conſent, that which according to the Rule of the Divine Law is the only Faith,</hi> Arius <hi>only was found, who overcome by diabolical fraud and deſign, did first ſow this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Evil among you and others; but let us embrace the Opinion which Almighty God hath delivered, and return to our Brethren, from whoſe Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip that impudent Miniſter of the Devil hath ſeparated them; for that which hath been decreed by more than</hi> 300 <hi>Biſhops, is to be eſteemed, as the Divine Sentence ſeeing that the Holy Ghost reſiding in their Minds, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his Divine Will unto them.</hi> He aſſured them alſo, <hi>That the Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of the Council were not made without diligent examination.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in another Epiſtle to the Biſhops and People, mentioned by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> p. 32. of the Edition by <hi>Valeſius,</hi> he ſays, <hi>That the</hi> Arians <hi>follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil and malitious Men, deſerved to ſuffer the ſame infamous puniſhment with them; and as</hi> Porphyry <hi>who wrote against the Chriſtian Religion had his Books deſtroyed, and himſelf branded to Poſterity; ſo it is my Command, That</hi> Arius <hi>and his Followers ſhall be call'd</hi> Porphyrians; <hi>and that if any Book written by</hi> Arius <hi>be found, that it be conſumed by Fire, that no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him may remain, and that ſuch as conceal his Books ſhall ſuffer Death.</hi> Theſe were the Emperour's ſecond thoughts.</p>
               <p>It hapned that <hi>Conſtantia</hi> the Emperour's Siſter had entertained an <hi>Arian</hi> Presbyter, who often talkt of <hi>Arius,</hi> complaining to her, how much he was wronged by the Council at <hi>Nice;</hi> but ſhe durſt not commend his Caſe to the Emperour, till being ſick, and often viſited by the Emperour, ſhe commended this Presbyter to the Emperour, as a devout and faithful Perſon, who having got into the Emperour's favour, he told him, as he had done his Siſter, <hi>of the hard meaſure</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius <hi>had from the Council, whom he affirmed to be of the ſame Judgment with them; and that if he might be admitted to the Emperour's preſence, he would declare his conſent to their Decrees.</hi> The Emperour wondered to hear this, and ſaid, <hi>That if</hi> Arius <hi>would ſubſcribe thoſe Decrees, he would not only admit him to his preſence, but ſend him home to</hi> Alexandria <hi>with Honour, and wrote to him to that purpoſe.</hi> See the Letter, <hi>Socrat. Hiſt.</hi> l. 1. c. 25. wondering that he had not declared ſooner, ſeeing, as the Hiſtorian ſays, the Emperour had often exhorted him to it; but being
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59637:44"/> come to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he with <hi>Euzoius,</hi> and ſome others, preſented the Emperour an Account of their Faith in Writing; which was this, <hi>To believe in One God the Father Almighty, and in the Lord Jeſus Christ his Son, who was made by him before all Ages; God the Word by whom all things in Heaven and Earth were made; who came down, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, who ſuffered and roſe again, and aſcended, and ſhall come to judge the Quick and Dead; and in the Holy Ghost, the Reſurrection of the Fleſh, and the Life to come; in One Catholick Church of God, from one end of the World to the other; this we believe, as God ſhall judge us now, and in the World to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On this Confeſſion the Emperour ordered his Return to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whether he went, and revived the Diviſions among the People, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming new Accuſations againſt <hi>Alexander;</hi> the Emperour therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called him to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to queſtion him for thoſe Tumults, which he had raiſed there: but the ſame miſchief followed him; for at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> he found his Friend <hi>Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> his Adverſary, whom <hi>Euſebius</hi> threatned, that he ſhould ſhortly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his Prieſthood, if he admitted not <hi>Arius</hi> into Communion; at which <hi>Alexander</hi> being greatly troubled, prays and faſts, ſhutting up himſelf in the Church called <hi>Irene,</hi> and coming to the Altar, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates himſelf on the Ground, under the holy Table, for many days and nights, asking of God (and he received what he asked), <hi>That if the Opinion of</hi> Arius <hi>were right, he might not live to the Day appointed for the Diſpute; but if the Faith which he profeſſed were true, that</hi> Arius <hi>might ſuffer the puniſhment due to his impiety.</hi> The Emperour in the mean time ſent for <hi>Arius,</hi> and willing to be better aſſured of the Faith which he profeſſed, asked him, <hi>Whether he would conſent to the Decrees of the Council of</hi> Nice? he preſently anſwered, <hi>He would;</hi> and did ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them in the Emperour's preſence; at which the Emperour wondered, and (ſuſpecting ſome fraud) urged him to ſwear to them; and this he did alſo. Now the fraud which he uſed, (as I have been informed, ſaith <hi>Socrates,</hi> c. 38.) was this: <hi>Arius</hi> had written his own Opinions in a Paper, which he had hid in his Boſome, and ſwore that he did in his Mind believe as he had written. Then the Emperour commanded <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was then Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him into Communion the day following: <hi>Arius</hi> being about to go into the Church with his Companions, the Judgment of God ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on him, for going out of the Emperour's Palace, he walked through the City magnificently guarded by a company of <hi>Euſebians,</hi> drawing all eyes upon him; when he came to a place where ſtood a Porphery Statue, a great terrour, through the conſciouſneſs of his wickedneſs, ſeiz'd on him, and with it a great Looſeneſs in his Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59637:45"/> and enquiring where he might ſtep aſide to eaſe himſelf, he was directed to a place near at hand, where being come, his Heart grew faint, and he voided his Bowels with his Excrements, with much Blood, and his Liver and Spleen followed; the place is yet to be ſeen, which all that paſs by do point at, relating the manner of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s death.</p>
               <p>Theſe Accidents did greatly confirm the Emperour in the Faith which was decreed in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> compares his Death with that of <hi>Judas, That is, not a fortuitous Death,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>where an Example of the like puniſhment on the like ſin was inflicted before, that both ſhould ſuffer the ſame puniſhment, who had denied and betrayed the ſame Lord;</hi> for <hi>Sozom.</hi> ſays, (as it is ſaid of <hi>Judas) that he burst aſunder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall only remark here, how much miſchief one <hi>Arian</hi> Presbyter by his falſe inſinuations with Men in Authority, may occaſion in a well-eſtabliſhed Church; which notwithſtanding all his arts and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, by God's good Providence, tended at laſt to the confirmation of the Truth.</p>
               <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 38. <hi>col.</hi> 1. he tells us of the Settlement of the Controverſie by <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> though he could not be ignorant that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had done it many years before; but he conceals the manner of doing it, <hi>(viz.) How that he being ſick at</hi> Theſſalonica, <hi>was baptized by</hi> Aſcolius <hi>Biſhop of that place</hi> (a Perſon of great eminency, both for his Words and Works, and adorned with all the Gifts of the Prieſtly Office); <hi>being recovered, he reſolved to propagate that Faith into which he was baptized, and which his Anceſtors had profest,</hi> (viz.) <hi>that of the</hi> Nicene <hi>Creed; and he greatly delighted in</hi> Aſcolius, <hi>as being of the ſame belief, as he did alſo in the</hi> Illirians, <hi>becauſe none of them were infected with the pest of</hi> Arian <hi>Doctrines: and asking concerning the other Provinces, he was informed, that all the Churches as far as</hi> Macedonia, <hi>did all agree in the ſame Faith, and did worſhip God, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, equally with the Father: and being told of the other Provinces towards the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>that they were tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and divided into ſeveral Sects, eſpecially at</hi> Conſtantinople; <hi>and then thinking it better to declare unto his Subjects his Opinion of the Deity, he ſent his Reſcript from</hi> Theſſalonica, <hi>to the People of</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>that from thence, as from the Fort of the Empire, his Reſcript might be ſpeedily iſſued to other Cities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now all this being in the ſame Chapter which the Doctor quotes, I wonder at the Doctor's Exclamations: <hi>Behold now the ground on which one of our Fundamental Articles of Faith is built! Behold the Juſtice of that Plea, which from ſuch a poſſeſſion would preſcribe to our belief: We have traced it,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>from the Spring, with no worſe intent,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59637:45"/> than to appeal from the Great</hi> Theodoſius, <hi>who put it above diſpute, to the Greater</hi> Conſtantine, <hi>who put it below diſpute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſeeing he appealed to <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> we have his Deciſion, which I find the Doctor as faulty, as he judged <hi>Arius</hi> to be. In the mean time, I ſuppoſe from his own Quotation, that the claim of poſſeſſion of this great Article of our Faith, is not either from the Great <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> nor from the Greater <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> nor the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> but from the Scripture, of him that is God over all, bleſſed for ever; and even <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf agrees with us in this, and differs from the Doctor, in his Third Epiſtle to <hi>Radecius,</hi> affirming, <hi>That even from the firſt beginning of the Church, there were ſo many Men most famous, as well for their Learning as their Piety, ſo many holy Martyrs of Christ which cannot be numbred, who followed this otherwiſe moſt grievous Errour, That Chriſt is that One God that created all things, and that he was begotten of his proper Subſtance.</hi> And may not the Church of <hi>England</hi> admire how one of her true Sons is ſo much more a <hi>Socinian</hi> than <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf, as to deny all this, that her Son ſhould ſuppreſs the Teſtimony which he knew to be true, to ſerve an Errour, which he knows to be falſe and damnable: Did the Settlement of Chriſt's Deity begin with the Reign of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and becauſe he found ſome Hereticks that denied it, was he the firſt that founded it? Shall we call the Doctor the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> becauſe he firſt publiſhed it in <hi>Exeter</hi>-Colledge? We can ſhew the Succeſſion of thoſe Apoſtles and Apoſtolick Men that have derived the Conſubſtantiality home to our days in all the Churches <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine;</hi> I ſuppoſe the Doctor will not glory in the Pedigree of his Hereſie, for ſo it hath been accounted ever ſince St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel was written; or what temptation could a Man of his Education have, to number the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Doctrine which he hath ſo long profeſt, if he be not an arrant Hypocrite; among the <hi>Roman, Theodoſius</hi> indeed recommended it to his Subjects, by a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz. That it was the Faith which St.</hi> Peter <hi>delivered at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Plantation of the Goſpel to the Church of</hi> Rome: Was St. <hi>Peter</hi> Popiſh, or was his Confeſſion, <hi>viz. Thou art Chriſt the Son of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God,</hi> a Popiſh Confeſſion? Were his Succeſſors for Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years, who were Confeſſors and Martyrs for the ſame Faith, Papal?</p>
               <p>I am heartily ſorry and aſhamed to hear, how (to recommend the <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrine) he proclaims the <hi>Arian,</hi> as well as the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Doctrine equally unworthy, not only of our Faith, but our Study; Is not this the Quinteſſence of <hi>Socinianiſm?</hi> See <hi>p,</hi> 39. <hi>c.</hi> 1. A very bold aſſertion is that which followeth, <hi>That at the riſe of the Controverſie, most of the Biſhops underſtood not its meaning, and that the best Ages of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59637:46"/> the Church thought it not worth the knowing.</hi> If by the firſt riſe of this Doctrine he means the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> as it is evident he doth, how they underſtood and valued it is beyond Controverſie, and how far it was tolerated by Biſhop <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom he calls the firſt Author of the Nicety, tolerated <hi>Arius,</hi> and his Confederates, by excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating and perſecuting him, until God by an extraordinary Judgment took him from troubling that Church, which he had redeemed by his own Blood, is known in the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of thoſe times; if his Scholars can preſume of God's Pardon, or of Communion with his Church from that inſtance, it is a ſtrong preſumption indeed; the beſt means is to do what he derides, that is, to herd with the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians and Martyrs, as he expreſſeth it, which departed the World before this unhappy Queſtion was propoſed; thoſe I mean, who died in the belief of their Saviour's Deity; and I hope it is of them he ſays, (and not of <hi>Cerinthus, Ebion,</hi> the <hi>Sabellians,</hi> and <hi>Samoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenians</hi>) that they are ſaved without diſpute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Athanaſius</hi> challenged the <hi>Arians</hi> to produce one Father of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in the Church of God, that was of the ſame Judgment with them; which they always ſtudiouſly declined, as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſhews by the inſtance of <hi>Siſinnius,</hi> l. 5. c. 10. And how the World came to be ſo much <hi>Arian</hi> as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> reports, is evident from St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> viz. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Teachers concealed their own Opinions, and uſed ſuch words in their Homelies to the People as the Catholicks did, whereby not only the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but Biſhops and Emperours were deceived by them:</hi> they told them, <hi>Chriſt was God, the true God, and God by Nature, perfect God before all Ages.</hi> And hence as St. <hi>Hilary</hi> notes, the People remained Catholicks under <hi>Arian</hi> Biſhops; but as he obſerves, <hi>Contra</hi> Arium <hi>&amp; Auxentium,</hi> p. 215. They had their reſerves, <hi>They give Christ the Name of God,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>but as they give the ſame to Men; they confeſs him to be the Son of God, but as others in the Sacrament of Baptiſm are made the Sons of God. They ſay he was before all Ages, and ſo they ſay were the Angels and Devils; but that Christ is the true God, that is, that the Deity of the Father and the Son is the ſame; this they deny: and hence it is,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that under the Prieſts of Antichriſt the People of Christ are not corrupted, while they believe that to be the Faith which they hear in their Teachers words:</hi> They hear that Chriſt is God, they believe what they hear; they hear that he is the Son of God, they believe it to be true; they hear in <hi>Dei nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate ineſſe Dei veritatem,</hi> they hear that he was before all Ages, they think he was Eternal: <hi>Sanctiores ſunt aures Plebis quam corda Sacerdotum,</hi> There is more Sanctity in the Ears of the People, than in the Hearts of the Prieſts. Thus was <hi>Conſtantius</hi> deceived; the <hi>Arian</hi> Prieſt, whom on the commendation of his dying Siſter he took into favour,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59637:46"/> perſwaded him, that <hi>Arius</hi> did believe all the Decrees of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and as an ancient Writer ſays, <hi>Hereticos admiſit Conſtantius Hereſin non Amplexus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If <hi>Conſtantius</hi> favoured the <hi>Arians,</hi> it was not from any favour he had to their Hereſie; and it is obſerved by <hi>Theodoret,</hi> l. 3. c. 8. that though he diſliked the word <hi>Conſubſtantial,</hi> yet he owned the ſence of it, <hi>That the Word was God, that Christ was the true and natural Son of God, begotten of the Father before all Ages, and condemn'd them that call'd him a Creature.</hi> And <hi>Greg. Nazianzen</hi> had the ſame Opinion of him, for he term'd him, <hi>The most Divine Emperour, and greatest Lover of Christ;</hi> and he was never accounted a Flatterer. The Councils alſo under him profeſt all the Articles of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, the word <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial</hi> only omitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elias Cretenſis</hi> gives this reaſon for the Laws which he made on the behalf of the <hi>Arians,</hi> That being deceived by wicked Men, he made Laws for their Toleration, againſt them that were pious. But this trick was learn'd them by one <hi>George,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> who argued thus: <hi>Seeing that God made all things, and all things were made of what was not, therefore the Son was made of things that were not, yet was he the Son of God as made by him. Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnis,</hi> who after great obſtinacy ſubſcribed to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Decrees, but would not conſent to the Condemnation of <hi>Arius,</hi> gave this reaſon for it; becauſe partly in the Letters which he wrote to them, and in the Conference they had with him, they could not judge him guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Opinions charged on him. See <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Letter in <hi>Socrates l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 38. He uſed that Maxime of <hi>Matchiavel, He that knows not how to diſſemble, knows not how to live:</hi> and therefore he complied with the Opinions of all of other Hereticks, but never could with the Orthodox, for which reaſon he was compared to the Camelion, of which Creature it is ſaid, it could conform itſelf to all Colours, except the White.</p>

                  <hi>P.</hi> 39. <hi>col.</hi> 2.

               <p>But this is an Argument for which he is beholding to <hi>Sandius</hi> the <hi>Arian,</hi> who <hi>p.</hi> 139. of his Appendix, ſpeaking of the Omniſcience of our Saviour, pleads, <hi>That ſuch expreſſions are taken from the Flowers of Rhetorick, by which the things treated of are ſometimes exalted, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times depreſſed, and in the preſent Subject</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is often given in the Praiſes due to Christ, againſt the Jews and Gentiles, thereby to aggrandize, not to depreciate him.</hi> Wherefore the Doctor commends the <hi>Arians</hi> for a truer Method, who when one expreſſion in Scripture ſeems to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict another, take ſuch a courſe to reconcile them, as the Laws and Cuſtoms of all the World direct, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> that thoſe expreſſions which exalt our Saviour, ſhould ſtoop to thoſe that depreſs him; and this he adds is the ſafer way, ſince it will lead us to ſuch a belief as will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for that end, for whoſe ſake alone belief itſelf is required.</p>

               <p>He rejects what Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> wrote on that ſubject, as inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for ſatisfaction, and ſays, <hi>It is like an Advertizement in a Gazett, which however exact, cannot ſecure from a miſtake, though we meet the Man deſcribed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon of this Reflection on Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> of whom I ſhall only ſay, That if in this or the former Age, there were any more learned, there was not one more pious; or if there were any more pious, there was none more learned, is, becauſe he hath ſo razed the very Foundations of <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> that there needs no more to be ſaid againſt it, than what that admirable Man hath written in that excellent Tract which the Doctor hath mentioned, as <hi>Bathſheba</hi> did <hi>Adonijah</hi> to King <hi>Solomon,</hi> againſt the Life of his Darling, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.23. for as no Man hath laid a better Foundation of Faith, it being the ſame which the Apoſtle laid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. ſo none hath been more careful of the Superſtructure of a Holy Life; and to prevent the laying on of ſuch combuſtible matter as Wood, Hay, or Stubble, of which I ſhall give the Reader a brief Extract, that he may ſee how invidiouſly the Doctor reflects on it, as inſufficient for our ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, <hi>p.</hi> 40. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin with <hi>p.</hi> 11. where Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> acknowledgeth, that he took the firſt hint of his Notion, from the words of that great Champion of the Catholick Faith, ſet down in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> in <hi>Epiſt. ad Epictetum,</hi> where ſpeaking of the Catholick Faith ſet down by the Canons of that Council, againſt the <hi>Arians,</hi> and other Hereticks, he ſays, <hi>The Faith confeſſed by the Biſhops in that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59637:47"/> Synod, according to the Divine Scripture, is of itſelf ſufficient for the aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all Impiety, and eſtabliſhment of all Piety in Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Then <hi>p.</hi> 27. <hi>This one Corner-ſtone Jeſus Christ, is a most competent ample Foundation on which to ſuperſtruct the largeſt Pile of Building, to erect a Church of pious Livers, and to bring all rational Men within the compaſs of it:</hi> which he aſſerts, <hi>p.</hi> 28. againſt the Doctor's Natural Religion; <hi>The Law written in Mens Hearts:</hi> Naturale Judicatorium, <hi>and a Light ſealed upon us in our firſt compoſure, becauſe the preſcribed Duties wanted their full ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if compared with Chriſt's ſuper-additions.</hi> 2. <hi>The fortifications againſt Temptations were too ſlender, there being little knowledge of the Soul's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and of Rewards and Puniſhments in another Life; on which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count St.</hi> Paul <hi>challengeth the wiſe Men of the World,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.20. <hi>Where is the wiſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let all the Scribes or Doctors of the Law, the Searchers or profound Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the Scripture, bring forth ſuch Evidences of their efficacy in reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and purifying Mens Lives, as the Apoſtles had done, by theſe ſo deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable means, the Goſpel of the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> p. 32. Then <hi>p.</hi> 33. he makes <hi>Mahomet</hi> (who, as our Doctor ſays, profeſt all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith) to have laid the grounds of all impurity in his carnal, ſenſual Paradice: and he concludes with a ſaying of <hi>Chalcidius</hi> in his Comment on <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Timaeus,</hi> which Dr. <hi>H.</hi> thinks he had from the Goſpel, and ſays it contains the ſum of it, <hi>That the Reaſon or Word of God, (no queſtion,</hi> ſays Dr. <hi>H. the</hi>

This ſtrikes the body of the <hi>Socinians</hi> to the heart; and then ſhews what is neceſſary to be believed concerning the Perſon of Chriſt, from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>(viz.) That he was God manifeſt in the fleſh:</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>That it is the great Myſtery of Piety,</hi> p. 42. (againſt the Doctor's deriding of Myſteries) of which he ſays, <hi>God was ſo intent on bringing Sinners to Repentance, that he was pleaſed to aſſume and manifeſt his will in, or by our fleſh, and as God viſible on Earth, to preach Reformation to us:</hi> and hence he ſays, <hi>All the Devils countermines in the firſt Ages of the Church, were deſigned purpoſely againſt this one Article, the Deity or God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt Incarnate,</hi> N. B. <hi>as if he were not what he oft affirmed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the Meſſias,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>the Eternal Son of God, and God bleſſed for
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59637:48"/> ever, which was ſo the known Title of the God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that whenever the God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>was named in the Jewiſh Services, it was anſwered by all, by their adding theſe words, God bleſſed for ever,</hi> p. 46.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Had it been only a Prophet, tho' never ſo great and extraordinarily fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Signs and Wonders, he had been but a Servant of God, and there are many Preſidents of reſiſting ſuch; but the perſonal deſcent of God himſelf, and his aſſumption of our Fleſh to his Divinity, was an enforcement beyond all the Methods of Wiſdom that were ever uſed in the World,</hi> p. 45. <hi>And the Doctrine of Ancient and Modern</hi> Arians <hi>and</hi> Photinians, <hi>who ſo induſtriouſly leſſen the Divinity of Chriſt, in pretence of Zeal to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to whom they will not permit him to be equal, extreamly takes off from the Myſtery of Piety, the Foundation of a good Life, laid in the Eternal God's coming down to preach it to us, and is a direct contradiction to thoſe places where Chriſt is called God,</hi> Acts 20.28. Tit. 2.13. And the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Socinians</hi> have taken out this principal Stone from the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God manifeſt in the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>P. 56. he ſays, <hi>That Baptiſm in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, is a Foundation on which they that adminiſtred it were commanded to ſuperſtruct all the Duties of a Chriſtian Life,</hi> Mat. 28.20. <hi>The Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all and each the Perſons of the Trinity, being purpoſely engaged in this one great Intereſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>H.</hi> having treated of the Apoſtles Creed, comes in <hi>p.</hi> 84. to ſhew, <hi>That what is ſuperadded, was apparently deſigned by the Compilers for ſome ſpecial uſe, to fence the Catholick Faith from the Corruptions, Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, Doubtings, and Contradictions of Hereticks, as in the</hi> Nicene <hi>Creed, the Oneneſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was added, when the</hi> Arians <hi>oppoſed the Apoſtolick Tradition, and by corrupting detected the words of Scripture to their ſence:</hi> which Dr. <hi>H.</hi> ſhews more largely in his Note on 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. and of ſuch Additions he ſays, <hi>That when the Church hath thought meet to erect an additional Bulwark againſt Hereticks, ſuch as reject them may be deemed to ſide with thoſe Hereticks,</hi> p. 86.</p>
               <p>And this is the ſumm of what he ſays concerning the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed, the Doctrine whereof he ſays, is (well nigh all) to aſſert the Unity of the Divine Nature and Trinity of Perſons, againſt thoſe Hereticks who had brought Novel Propoſitions into the Church, of which Doctrinal part he ſays, that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> being only a Father of the Church, they were not neceſſary to be explicitely acknowledged, nor abſolutely impoſed on any but ſuch as were Members of ſome Church, that had actually received <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s Explication, or than it appeared concordant with the more authentick univerſal Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as every Doctrinal Propoſition of it will be found to do.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:59637:48"/>
               <p>As for the Damnatory Sentences, Dr. <hi>Ham.</hi> ſuppoſeth them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted in oppoſition to thoſe Hereſies that had invaded the Church, not that it defined it to be a damnable ſin to fail in underſtanding or believing the full matter of any of thoſe Explications. Dr. <hi>Ham.</hi> having as a wiſe Maſter Builder, laid this Foundation, ſhews <hi>how neceſſary it is for the end of building on it a holy Life, and an uniform univerſal Obedience to the Commands of Chriſt, in oppoſition to Idolatry, Formality, Hypocriſie, and to Sacriledge, Profaneneſs, and Impiety; as alſo to improve the Vertues of Obedience to Superiours, Charity to all Mankind, Purity of Fleſh and Spirit, Contentedneſs and taking up the Croſs; and laſtly, how uſeful it is to confute falſe Doctrines,</hi> 1. <hi>Of the</hi> Romaniſts, <hi>as Penances, Indulgences, of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererrogating Merits, of Attrition improved into Contrition by the Prieſt's aid, without change of Life, Diſpenſableneſs of Oaths, Arts of Equivocation, Purgatory, Ceſſation of Allegiance, and eſpecially of Infallibility.</hi> 2ly, <hi>Of the Solifidians and Fiduciaries, the Predeſtinarians, and irreſpective Decrees of Election and Reprobation, of the Divine Preſcience, againſt the</hi> Socinians, <hi>who deny that God foreſees all things, and though they grant his Omnipreſence, and Omnipotence, yet queſtion the infinity of his Science, which is apparently falſe, as appears by God's Predictions to the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I conſidered the Writings of both theſe Doctors, their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and Superſtructures, it brought to my mind thoſe two ſorts of Builders and Building mentioned by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. the one built on that <hi>approved Rock of St.</hi> Peter<hi>'s Confeſſion;</hi> the other on that Sand; whereon <hi>Arius, Socinus,</hi> and that Man of an ominous Name, <hi>Sandius,</hi> pitcht their Tabernacles, the one ſtands firm, tho' for 1600 Years, the Rain deſcended, Flouds came, and the Wind blew on it; the other, tho' like the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it hath been often attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be faſtned, hath ſtill been blown down; and may the Fall of it be ſtill great.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 41. <hi>c.</hi> 2. Our Doctor ſays, <hi>If the Relation between the written Word, and rational Conſequence be ſo remote, as none but a skilful Herald can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive its Pedigree, then is a good Chriſtian no more obliged to believe ſuch an Inference, than is every good Subject to be a good Herald.</hi> As if the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant were no ways obliged to follow the Directions of the wiſe and good Men; or as if Subjects were not bound to obey thoſe Laws, whereof they cannot ken thoſe Reaſons which the wiſe and conſulting Legiſlators on good Reaſons have eſtabliſhed for their Security.</p>
               <p>What tho' the Papiſts do moſt abſurdly infer from Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to feed his Lambs, that all thoſe Popes which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be his Succeſſors are thereby commiſſioned to Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern all Nations and Perſons in all Ages. Cannot ſo enquiring a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as the Doctor, or one that is more, or one that is leſs rational,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59637:49"/> from ſuch Scriptural premiſes, as God was made Fleſh, Chriſt is God over all, equal and one with his Father, with undeniable Reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, as the Catholick Church in all Ages hath done, <hi>That he is the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Son of God?</hi> But ſuch an Inference is ſo contrary to the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>'s Reaſon, that it is equally rejected with contempt and deriſion, as Popiſh Impoſitions, and by the Doctor numbred among them. But <hi>Bernardus non videt omnia:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He undertakes therefore to bleſs the World with ſuch a deſcription of them, that it ſhall be as eaſie to know them, without pains or art, as it was for the meaneſt Beggar in the ſtreet, to underſtand whom King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> would Honour, when he cauſed <hi>Mordecai</hi> in Royal Manner to be publickly honoured, and by Proclamation enjoyned the People to bow the Knee, as he paſt by them.</p>
               <p>The Qualifications for Matter of Faith, he ſays, muſt be theſe: 1. It muſt be eaſie to be underſtood by the meaneſt capacity; and therefore he rejects any thing that is called a Myſtery, though God manifeſted in the Fleſh be ſo called by the Apoſtle; yea, though the ſame Myſtery be implied in that very Scripture which he quotes to prove his aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> Rom. 10.9. <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>that Jeſus is the Lord, which no man can ſay, but by the Holy Ghost: (i. e.)</hi> not by a natural Faith, but by a ſupernatural Revelation, ſuch as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſays, <hi>Fleſh and blood hath not revealed.</hi> And it is obſervable, that though in the Title of this Chapter, he mentioneth <hi>the Word,</hi> as well as the <hi>Matter</hi> to be believed, yet he makes no mention of <hi>the Word,</hi> by which the Perſon of our Saviour is generally underſtood; ſo that Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Foundation of our Faith is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from being the Object of our belief; for he writes the WORD in a larger Character, which might induce the Reader to believe, that he meant as St. <hi>John</hi> 1.1. <hi>The Son of God;</hi> which is the adequate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Chriſtian Faith, but ſpeaks nothing of him in all that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly, He ſays, <hi>It muſt be an expreſs Word of God:</hi> This no Proteſtant denieth; but they do generally urge it againſt the Papiſts, who teach as neceſſary Articles of Faith the Commandments of Men: And may we not conclude by this Poſition, that they who oppugne ſuch a Fundamental, to which Eternal Life is promiſed, may come ſhort of Salvation.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that believes and is baptized;</hi> this is but one entire propoſition as our Author obſerves, that it is not only he that believes, but he that believes and is baptized; and Salvation cannot belong to them that put aſunder what Chriſt hath joyned, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> do in the Caſe of Baptiſm, which they call only a Rite and Ceremony.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:59637:49"/>3ly, He ſays, <hi>It must be expreſly honoured with the promiſe of Eternal Life to the Believer:</hi> and therefore he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 42. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi>Whoever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it to any other Doctrine however true, however revealed, makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf equal to Chriſt in Authority, and ſuperiour in Faithfulneſs:</hi> If then that Scripture of our Saviour, <hi>This is life eternal to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou hast ſent,</hi> Joh. 20.31. And 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20. <hi>We are in him that is true, even his Son Jeſus Chriſt; this is the true God and eternal life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.20. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reads the Text thus, <hi>To know thee, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent, to be the only true God:</hi> and ſo doth St. <hi>Chryſoſtom.</hi> Now if I ſay, Eternal Life be appropri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ate to this knowledge, that Chriſt is the true God, then it is a funda<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mental Article of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 43. <hi>There can be no need of an Interpreter of Scripture, or Determiner of Doubts concerning Matters of Faith,</hi> ſaith the Doctor: How then comes it to paſs, that there are ſo many Controverſies concerning Matters of Faith? and that each Party denies Salvation to their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, that differ from them? His appeal to natural Faith will never be able to determine the Controverſies that are yet undecided, concerning ſuch Fundamental Doctrines as are neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Socinus de Adoratione Chriſti,</hi> ſays, <hi>Bonas rationes &amp; rectas ex verbo dei conſecutiones in ſacris diſputationibus aſpernare nec admittere velle, hominis eſt ſuae cauſae parum fidentis.</hi> He ſays, 3. <hi>We need not, ought not to be unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to any who differ from us in other Doctrines, to the belief whereof the Promiſe is not appropriate.</hi> But is Eternal Life any where promiſed to thoſe that believe that Jeſus Chriſt was only a Creature, and a meer Man? Can we hope for Salvation, without ſatisfaction to the Divine Juſtice? or can we make ſatisfaction? Is it not good Divinity to ſay, there is no Salvation but in the Name, and through the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, who died for our Sins, and roſe again for our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?</p>
               <p>I have ſhewn you how the Doctor would interpret this latter Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>ult. Commodius interpretationis</hi> (as they call them) there; but if their little Criticiſms, and falſe Punctations ſhould be admitted, the Scriptures would indeed be made, as he ſays, <hi>A Noſe of Wax;</hi> witneſs their interpretation of <hi>John</hi> 8.58. <hi>Before Abraham was, I am,</hi> (i. e.) ſay they, <hi>Before Abraham was made the Father of the Faithful, and of many Nations that were converted by the preaching of the Goſpel, I am,</hi> viz. <hi>the Light of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Eniedinus</hi> renders the Confeſſion of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> as an Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion directed to God the Father, <hi>O my Lord, and my God; as</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we are wont to do, when we behold any ſtrange ſight.</hi> And Chriſt's
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59637:50"/> words to the Thief, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. are thus pointed, <hi>I ſay unto thee this day: Thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe,</hi> viz. <hi>When I ſhall come to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Francis David,</hi> on the words of St. <hi>Stephen, Act.</hi> 7.59. makes this Comment, <hi>O God the Father who art the Lord of Jeſus receive my Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this <hi>ch. p.</hi> 44. <hi>c.</hi> 2. the Doctor ſays, <hi>that the Remiſſion which the prophets promiſed, reached only to temporal puniſhments, but that by Chriſt to eternal life:</hi> How then can a natural Faith ſecure us of Life eternal, when that Faith, though greatly improved by the Prophets, could not do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ch.</hi> 11. in this Chapter he revives and pleads for another <hi>Socinian</hi> Tenet; <hi>for the Reſurrection, not of the ſame, but another Body.</hi> He propounds the Queſtion thus, <hi>Whether any Promiſe doth neceſſarily import a reſtitution of the ſame numerical Matter;</hi> and undertakes to prove, <hi>That it is more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to God, and more ſerviceable to the Deſign of the Goſpel, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the contrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Firſt, This is contrary to the Grammatical Signification of the Word, and to the Scripture by him quoted, <hi>viz. That God gives to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſeed his own Body:</hi> And <hi>Ruffinus</hi> mentions the word <hi>Hujus,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of this Body, which though it ſhall have a kind of Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration, by ſubſtraction of the old earthly Qualities, and the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch as are new and heavenly, yet the ſubject ſhall continue the ſame; which St. <hi>Paul</hi> means, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.53. <hi>This corruptible ſhall put on incorruption; that as we have born the image of the earthly, we may bear the image of the heavenly;</hi> and as <hi>Job</hi> ſays, <hi>With theſe eyes ſee God,</hi> Job 19.25. And the Juſtice of God requires this, that as the Faithful have born the Marks of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in their Bodies, wherein they were Partakers of the Sufferings of Chriſt, and were conſecrated to him as the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, may partake of the Reward and Crown of Glory in the ſame Bodies.</p>
               <p>What he ſays of our being <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, proves as well, that we ſhall have no Bodies, as that we ſhall not have the ſame. The change that ſhall be made in our vile Bodies, doth not alter the form of our Bodies, no more than it doth the Body of Chriſt, which though it be now a glorious Body, yet is ſtill the ſame numerical Body; and to call that a Load of Carion, which the Apoſtle calls the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, is not becoming a Chriſtian Doctor. As we believe therefore that the ſame Body our Saviour which ſuffered, is now glorified, and that the ſame Bodies that remain to the laſt day, ſhall be taken up to meet the Lord in the Air, ſhall be the ſame Bodies that ſhall be ever with the Lord. And as we believe that Chriſt aroſe from the Grave
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59637:50"/> in the ſame Body wherein he died, ſo we believe that he carried the ſame into the heavenly Sanctuary, and ſhall come at laſt in the ſame Body to judge both the Quick and Dead, that all Eyes may look on their Crucified Saviour; and unleſs it ſhall be the ſame Body, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not properly be called a Reſurrection: And no doubt but our Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ſhall be conform with that of Chriſt's, as the Apoſtle inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. <hi>He that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies.</hi> To this purpoſe St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Epl. 57. <hi>That as Chriſt glorified his own Body, but deſtroyed not its nature, ſo will he give Glory to our Bodies, but not take away the nature of them.</hi> Nor indeed do other qualities any more alter the nature of our Bodies than of our Souls, which for ſubſtance ſhall be the ſame.</p>
               <p>But laſtly, if this Enquiry be a matter of Curioſity, not of Faith, why doth he oppoſe the Doctrine ſo long received in the Church, to bring in a <hi>Socinian</hi> Tenet?</p>
               <p>And now <hi>p.</hi> 50. <hi>c.</hi> 1. he gives us the <hi>Socinian</hi> Scheme of the <hi>Naked Goſpel,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Socinus, Crellius, Sclichtingius, Smalcius,</hi> and the whole Tribe have fancied and publiſhed to the World before him: <hi>That its buſineſs was to reduce the</hi> Jews <hi>from their Bondage under the Law of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; <hi>and the</hi> Gentiles <hi>from their worſe bondage under the Worſhip of Devils, to the Service of God by the free Directions of their own Nature: That to this end he ſent his only begotten Son into the World teaching them, That the beſt ſervice of God conſiſteth in being like him, and for their encouragement therein, promiſing them upon their Repentance pardon of Sins paſt, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life.</hi> This, ſaith he, is the Sum of the Goſpel, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of his <hi>Naked Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is not a word of that Grace and Truth that came by Jeſus, nor that God was in Chriſt reconciling the World to himſelf, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him to be ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God in him.</hi> Not a word of that Redemption (which St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of made for us) by the precious Blood of the Son of God, or that Chriſt redeemed the Church by his own Blood, dying for our Sins, and riſing again for our Juſtification, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. waſhing us in his own Blood from our Sins. Not a word of that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> made his whole work to preach, <hi>Chriſt crucified, that others with him might know him, and the power of his reſurrection, that we may be found in him, not having our own righteouſneſs, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith,</hi> Phil. 3.8, 9. Nor that without the ſhedding of this Blood, there could be no Remiſſion of Sins.</p>
               <p>But though the Apoſtle counts this knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus his Lord, ſo excellent, that all things elſe are <hi>but loſs and</hi>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59637:51"/> in compariſon with it:</hi> Yet the Doctor prefers his <hi>Natural Faith,</hi> or his <hi>Carnal Reaſon</hi> above all this; for there is not one word of all this to cover the Nakedneſs of his New-born Goſpel, but as the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay, <hi>God ſent his only begotten Son into the World, to teach them</hi> (not to die for them) <hi>how by the free Directions of their own Nature without any grace or aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God, or any Revelations of that Grace and Truth that came by him: That the beſt ſervice of God conſiſts in being like him; to which end he ſuppoſeth the free Dictates of their own Nature are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;</hi>

               <p>Not a word of Chriſt's giving Repentance, or that eternal Life is the gift of God, which he grounds on that Repentance which flows from the free Directions of their own Nature. What part Faith hath in all this, is his next Enquiry, which is to ſhew that it hath no part at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Enquiry</hi> II. He ſays is to ſhew, <hi>What Changes or Additions later Ages have made in Matter of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He tells us <hi>p.</hi> 50. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>That our Lord honoured it as the Great King did</hi> Daniel, <hi>above all his Princes: That he came into the World to advance it: That he promiſed it eternal Life; and both he and his Apoſtle make it half the Goſpel; we meet it in every page of the New Teſtament; and on ſight of its glory, we talk as St.</hi> Peter <hi>did when confounded at the brightneſs of our Lord, we know not what.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our Author hath no ſooner cried his <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to Faith, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did to Chriſt, but preſently proclaims his Crucifigite, and caſts this <hi>Daniel</hi> into a Lion's Den, to be rent by ſuch furious Beaſts: he firſt caſts her from the Throne wherein Chriſt placed it, and what the Goſpel makes the Mother-Grace, he makes the Mother-Error; <hi>p.</hi> 51. <hi>c.</hi> 1. his words are, <hi>This is the Mother-Error, that whereas Faith is no better than a Retainer to Holineſs, we place it in the Throne as an Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Prince, and think it our Duty to enlarge its Dominions as far, and exalt its Prerogative as high as we can, as if it were ſome precious Diamond, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable for its Brightneſs, Hardneſs, or other irreſpective Vertue of its own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doth this Author know what he ſays, or conſider whereof he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms theſe things? If it be of that implicite Faith required in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or that naked Faith of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> or <hi>Solifidians,</hi> viz. <hi>a bare profeſſion of Faith in Chriſt, ſeparate from Obedience,</hi> he only beats the Air; but if of that Faith required in the Goſpel, and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the nature whereof he cannot but know, then he ſtriks at the very Life of Chriſtian Religion; for that is a Faith working by Love; a Faith in Chriſt's meritorious Death,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59637:51"/> Paſſion, Reſurrection, and Interceſſion; which the <hi>Socinians</hi> will not admit of: A Faith that purifieth the Heart, that teacheth us that Chriſt dying for all, all were dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes, and that he died for all; that henceforth they ſhould not live to themſelves, but unto him that died for them, and roſe again: this is the true Chriſtian Faith grounded on the Grace of God, <hi>which bringeth ſalvation, and hath appeared to all men, teaching them, that denying ungodlineſs and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts, they ſhould live righteouſly, ſoberly and godly in this preſent world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This the end of manifeſting the Goſpel as St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 16.26. This the Obedience of Faith? This is the Faith which we preach in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and which the Doctor ſo oppoſeth and vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth. It is evident that the Faith which this Doctor would degrade, is that which hath for its Object Chriſt crucified, bearing our Sins, making an Atonement, bearing the Chaſtiſement of our Peace, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling us to God by the Sacrifice on the Croſs.</p>
               <p>All which he would reſolve into a Natural Faith in the Veracity of God, and ſo makes our Faith in Chriſt crucified (the chiefeſt Notion of a juſtifying Faith) to be of none effect.</p>
               <p>But let us hear the Reaſon he gives for his degrading of Faith, <hi>p.</hi> 50. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>We conſider not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that two of the reaſons which induced our Lord to call ſo importunately for it are expired.</hi> Thoſe Reaſons I ſuppoſe we had <hi>p.</hi> 19. <hi>c.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>The Difficulties of believing.</hi> 2. <hi>The Danger of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing it.</hi> To which there needs no other Anſwer, then what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath given, <hi>p.</hi> 50. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>That Faith muſt neceſſarily be called for with importunity ſuitable both to the Difficulties and Dangers which at that time encompaſſed it; and to the ſerviceableneſs which at all times accompanies it:</hi> For is there not now alſo need of Faith to ſtrengthen us againſt the Temptations of the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil? Or is our Fight now only againſt Fleſh and Bloud? are there not Spiritual Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes alſo? Are there not ſuch Luſts as are as dear as a right Hand or Eye, that muſt be cut off? And what is it that giveth us the Victory over theſe, and a world of others, but our Faith?</p>
               <p>Were not our Faith ſerviceable to theſe ends, he might have ſome excuſe for calling our Saviour a humerſome and capricious Lord, as he doth <hi>p.</hi> 51. <hi>c.</hi> 1. and <hi>p.</hi> 57. <hi>c.</hi> 2. that without any other motive than his unaccountable will, impoſeth a ſtupid belief of a multitude of impertinent and incredible Propoſitions, without, yea, (ſome of them) againſt all Reaſon, without any fruit but ſtrife, contrary to the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity wherein the Goſpel glorieth, and to that contempt which God himſef ſheweth to acts of mee<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:59637:52"/>
               <p>Doth not the Doctor fix theſe opprobrious Terms on our Bleſſed Saviour, when it is evident, that our Saviour inſtituted the Sacrament of Baptiſm to be adminiſtred in his Name, as well as in the Name of the Father and the Holy Ghoſt; eſpecially ſeeing the Doctor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny Baptiſm to be a Fundamental of the Chriſtian Religion, as having an expreſs Precept, and a Promiſe of Eternal Life annexed to it? And to be baptized in the Name of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is to devote ourſelves to the Worſhip and Obedience of the Perſon, in whoſe Name we are baptized; and by conſequence being we are baptized equally into the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them to be of equal Dignity, and are obliged to pay them equal Worſhip. This Precept of our Saviour being no part of the Doctor's <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> but a prime Fundamental of the Chriſtian, doth irrefragably convince the Doctor to be guilty of groſs Impiety, when he in <hi>p.</hi> 57. <hi>c.</hi> 2. and <hi>p.</hi> 51. <hi>c.</hi> 1. diſcourſing of the Changes which later Ages have made in Matters of Faith, under which, by the tendency of the whole Book, that of the Doctrine of the Trinity is chiefly intended, he infers our Saviour to be a <hi>humorous and caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord;</hi> and what means this paſſage <hi>p.</hi> 30. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>That it muſt caſt diſhonour no leſs on his Wiſdom than his Majeſty,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>if we think he will grant Salvation on no other Terms, than a belief of the whole truth concerning the Dignity of his Perſon; for this will imply that he came and ſuffered on purpoſe to purchaſe to himſelf the honour of ſuch a Belief,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 52. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>The proper Dominions of Faith,</hi> he ſays, <hi>exceed not this one propoſition, That God cannot lye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> What difference then is there between the Faith of a <hi>Jew</hi> or a <hi>Turk,</hi> and that of a Chriſtian, they believe this as firmly as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor doth, and are they as much Chriſtians as he?</p>
               <p>He allows it no value from its relation to the Perſon of Chriſt, though he doubteth not the Perſon of Chriſt to be infinitely valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: The <hi>Turks</hi> grant he was a juſt Man, and a true Prophet, but not an All-ſufficient Saviour. But who are they that advance Faith above Holineſs, yea, againſt it too? not only the thorough pac'd <hi>Antinomians</hi> and <hi>Solifidians,</hi> but many who call themſelves Orthodox, who ſay, <hi>Faith is the hand whereby we apply Chriſt to ourſelves; and by this application Chriſt is made ours, and his Righteouſneſs imputed to us, as if it were our own, and it juſtifies not by its own worthineſs, but by the Merit of Chriſt, which it lyeth hold on, and applieth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I perceive the Doctor learnt this from Mr. <hi>Beedle</hi>'s Preface to his <hi>Socinian Catechiſm,</hi> where he rejects the ſame Tenets, becauſe they are not to be found in expreſs terms in Scripture, (viz.) <hi>The apprehending and applying of Chriſt's righteouſneſs to ourſelves by Faith; of Chriſt's righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59637:52"/> imputed to us; of Chriſt's dying to appeaſe the wrath of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile us to him; of Chriſt's Merits, or his meritorious Obedience, both active and paſſive:</hi> of which he ſays, <hi>That as theſe forms of ſpeech are not owned by the Scripture, ſo neither the things contained in them.</hi> I doubt not but the Doctor read that Preface, and applies it to the ſame end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And where in the name of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith our Author) <hi>do we in all the Book of God, or in Reaſon,</hi> (which he alway equalleth with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) <hi>meet any intimation of this fine Doctrine, Application of Chriſt to our ſelves; the hand of Faith, imputed Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>What are they but Terms of Art, invented by falſe Apoſtles?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But were the Compilers of our Liturgy falſe Apoſtles? Or do we not find the matter, if not the words therein, when we pray God to deliver us by his Croſs and Paſſion? Or is there no Merit in them, when we are taught to pray, <hi>That by the Merits and Death of Jeſus Chriſt, and through Faith in his Bloud, we and the whole Church may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Remiſſion of Sins, and all other benefits of his Paſſion.</hi> See the Prayer after the Communion.</p>
               <p>Do not they inform us of the<note n="*" place="margin">In Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> meritorious Croſs and Paſſion of our Saviour, whereby alone we obtain Remiſſion of our Sins, and are made Partakers of the Kingdom of Heaven? Or was he a falſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle that teacheth us, <hi>That Christ was made ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Doctor will not recede a hairs breadth from his <hi>Socinian</hi> Principles leſt he ſhould acknowledge, that Chriſt died for our Sins, and roſe for our Juſtification, which he ſays, the particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> will not bear, <hi>p.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>The Doctor is much pleaſed with his Microſcope, which diſcovers a multitude of little Animals, where the beſt eye ſees nothing but lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Water: But had he a ſpiritual Eye he might by the Mirror of the Goſpel, diſcover many ſaving Truths, which to a carnal Eye are not diſcernable.</p>
               <p>Another Complaint againſt Faith is, p. 54. <hi>That it is exalted above and against Charity:</hi> and he calls the Diſpute (between the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Catholicks</hi> concerning the Eternal Deity of Chriſt) <hi>the firſt and moſt uncharitable Diſpute that ever rent the Chriſtian World.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 55. c. 1.</note> But who began theſe Diſputes but <hi>Ebion, Cerinthus,</hi> and the <hi>Arians,</hi> who uſed the Goſpel as the poor Man was uſed that fell among Theives, left it naked and wounded, and oppoſed all that came to its relief; were we all united in the Faith of the Goſpel, which teacheth us, that <hi>we have one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, viz.</hi> in the Holy Trinity; it would be a more effectual means to enlarge Charity, than the new Hereſies that deny the Lord that bought them; and being unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59637:53"/> to their Lord, cannot be otherwiſe to his Servants; they that thus wound the Head, the Deity of Chriſt, cannot but rent the Members, who by that Faith are united to him: The old Serpent was permitted to bruiſe the <hi>Heel of the Meſſiah, (i. e.)</hi> as Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſay, <hi>his natural Body of fleſh and blood;</hi> but theſe Serpents attempt his Head, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> his <hi>Divinity;</hi> but in vain, for he ſhall break their heads.</p>
               <p>The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt our Faith, that Chriſt is the Son of the Living God; upon which Chriſt hath founded his Church.</p>
               <p>The great Complaint againſt Faith is yet behind, <hi>That it is exalted above and againſt Reaſon; for nothing is to be believed further than Reaſon proveth it to be true,</hi> p. 56. c. 1. That is, the <hi>Socinians</hi> Reaſon. But by the aſſiſtance of Faith, the Chriſtian may believe things above Reaſon, though to a carnal Apprehenſion they ſeem contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Why elſe doth our Saviour pronounce them bleſſed, that have not ſeen, and yet believed, <hi>(viz.)</hi> as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> did) that Chriſt is their Lord and their God.</p>
               <p>This is another great Fortreſs of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> from which they tell us, in the Doctor's Language, <hi>That Articles of Faith above the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Reaſon, are like the Ravings in</hi> Bedlam, <hi>p.</hi> 56. <hi>c.</hi> 1. A caſt of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s <hi>Montaniſm, Credo quia impoſſibile; and that exceſs of Confidence</hi> (he means our Chriſtian Faith) <hi>in defect of Reaſon is a certain ſymptom of Madneſs.</hi> To this Fortreſs, as their Frontier Gariſon, all the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> reſort; nothing can be believed which cannot be underſtood and comprehended by Reaſon. So <hi>Schlinchtingius</hi> againſt <hi>Meiſner, It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a Contradiction, that what exceeds the reach of Reaſon ſhould be made an Article of Faith:</hi> As if when the God of Heaven revealing his Will doth injoyn any Commandment, or requires the belief of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition upon his Authority, which the reaſon of his Creatures is not able to comprehend, or demonſtrate to itſelf, he did enjoyn the belief of Contradictions. As in our Author's inſtance, when <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved againſt Hope and againſt his Reaſon, he believed on the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God that required him to offer up his only Son <hi>Iſaac;</hi> And why may we not as well believe that God ſent his Eternal Son to be Incarnate, and come down from Heaven for our Redemption; tho' we cannot comprehend it, we ought to believe the thing, tho' we cannot comprehend the manner.</p>
               <p>Natural Faith relieth upon natural Reaſon, but Divine Faith upon Revelation, which may be above, but not againſt Reaſon: If you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any other Teſtimony, it is not Faith, <hi>Vides</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine) non est fides;</hi> what thou aſſenteſt to becauſe thou ſeeſt a reaſon for, it
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59637:53"/> is not Faith, <hi>Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11.1. That properly is Faith, which gives up its aſſent to a Propoſition on the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of him that propounds it; and in this caſe we ſay with the Doctor, <hi>Let God be true, and Humane Reaſon a Lyar.</hi> Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath the judgment of Diſcretion; the judgment of Deciſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Scriptures; to the Scriptures I ſay, not as underſtood by any private Interpretation, but as interpreted by the Analogy of Faith, by the Harmony of the Old and New Teſtament, and by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſent of the beſt Teachers in all Ages; and to this we ſhall Appeal for the Deciſion of this great Truth, That our Saviour is the Eternal Son of God.</p>
               <p>There are certainly more plain Contradictions in the <hi>Arian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines in this, viz. <hi>That there ſhould be an Omnipotent and Omniſcient God that created all things, and knows the ſecrets of all hearts, and that this ſhould be a created God;</hi> for the <hi>Arians</hi> grant <hi>Christ to be the Creator of the World.</hi> That God ſhould be reconciled to Man, that by Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion is his Enemy, hating, and hateful to God, without any ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to his Juſtice; this is to reconcile Light and Darkneſs, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell, or that a Finite Creature, as a Created God muſt be, could ſatisfy an infinitely offended Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any Article of our Chriſtian Faith that ſeems ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Reaſon, as is their meaſuring of an Infinite Eſſence by Finite Reaſon; that which meaſureth ſhould be able to contain the thing that is meaſured.</p>
               <p>Again, To give Divine Worſhip to a Creature, by what Name ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be dignified or diſtinguiſhed, which is due only to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, our Creator, is contrary both to ſound Reaſon and Scripture, which the <hi>Socinians</hi> (ſome of them at leaſt) do, and on their own Principles are guilty of Idolatry.</p>
               <p>The Difference among the <hi>Socinians</hi> concerning giving Divine Worſhip to Chriſt, will ſave us the labour of proving them to be Ido<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>laters, if Chriſt be not the Eternal Son of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Socinus</hi> would not hold him for a Chriſtian, <hi>that would not worſhip Christ with Divine Worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Chriſtianus Frankin, Francis David,</hi> and ſome others (who agreed with <hi>Socinus,</hi> that Chriſt was but a Man) urge this Argument to prove <hi>Socinus</hi> and his Followers to be Idolaters, becauſe they worſhipped him, whom they believed to be but a Creature.</p>
               <p>The Argument is thus formed: <hi>As great as is the diſtance between a Creator and a Creature, ſo great ought the difference be of the Honour that is given to the Creator from that which is given to the Creature: but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between the Creator and Creature is the greatest diſtance, therefore
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59637:54"/> there ought to be the greatest difference in the Honour that is given to the Creator from that which is given to a Creature.</hi> Hence they conclude <hi>Socinus</hi> and his Followers who worſhipped Chriſt with Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip were Idolaters.</p>
               <p>But to this they anſwer, <hi>That if it be the pleaſure of God to have it ſo, ſo it muſt be;</hi> and for this they quote St. <hi>John</hi> 5.23. <hi>That all men ſhould honour the Son as they honour the Father.</hi> To this <hi>Franken</hi> replys, <hi>That by</hi> Socinu<hi>'s own Doctrine the Scripture he ſays muſt not be believed, becauſe it is contrary to Reaſon, and therefore there is ſome other hidden ſence in that Scripture which muſt be ſearched out. N. B.</hi> and <hi>Franken</hi> urgeth <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. repeated <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> And it is farther urged, that <hi>Crellius</hi> ſaith the word only in <hi>John</hi> 17.3. where Chriſt ſays, <hi>This is life eternal to know thee the only true God;</hi> that by it Chriſt excludes himſelf from being the true God. And by the ſame word, ſay his Adverſaries, Chriſt excludes himſelf from being the Object of Divine Worſhip.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Franken</hi> confirms farther againſt <hi>Socinus,</hi> from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.8. <hi>My glory will I not give to another:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſai. 48.11.</note> and obſerve who ſpeaks, <hi>I am Jehovah, that is my name, and my glory,</hi> &amp;c. What Glory is that? <hi>Gloria Jehovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis mea,</hi> as <hi>Calomus</hi>'s Phraſe is; that is, <hi>The Glory of my Godhead.</hi> So in <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.18. <hi>That men may know that thou whoſe name alone is Jehovah art the moſt High. Jehovah</hi> then is the Name of the moſt high God, and his alone, ſo that it cannot be given to any other who is not the moſt high God: but this name <hi>Jehovah</hi> is given to Chriſt in the Scripture, therefore he is the moſt high God. This Argument ſhall be confirmed hereafter. In the mean time we have gained this Point, <hi>viz.</hi> That if Chriſt be the Object of Divine Worſhip, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> grant, then muſt he be the Eternal Son of God, of the ſame Eſſence with his Father; and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>God over all, bleſſed for ever.</hi>

               <p>Now if the word only in St. <hi>John</hi> exclude Chriſt from being the true God, then the ſame word in <hi>Deut.</hi> and St. <hi>Matthew</hi> exclude him from Divine Worſhip; wherefore if his being the true God, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Reaſon of <hi>Socinians,</hi> though never ſo plain in Scripture, we muſt ſearch out ſome other hidden ſence, as <hi>Socinus</hi> ſays; and what other or better ſence can we find, than what the Catholick Church alway affirmed, viz. <hi>That Chriſt with his Father and the Holy Ghost is the only true God.</hi> And thus St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as hath been ſaid, renders it, <hi>This is Life eternal to know thee, and Jeſus Christ whom thou haſt ſent, to be the only true God,</hi> Cont.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59637:54"/> declaring he had a</hi> Noſtrum <hi>which never failed to cure thoſe that truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; that it coſt him dear, but he would freely communicate it to all that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſir'd it, and exhorted all to come to him; which many did, and were cured, but ſome ſaid there needed no more but to truſt to the Medicine: The Phyſitian was infinitely skilful in his Art, and faithful in his Promiſes, wherefore by confidence in him, they ſhould have all his health imputed to them, and that ſhould cure them as perfectly as if they received real health by the uſe of his Preſcriptions.</hi> This is a Fiction of his own, to ſerve his Hypotheſis, which I ſhall anſwer by a more probable Story out of the <hi>Midras Tehillim,</hi> or the Expoſition of the Pſalms, where on thoſe words, <hi>Kiſs the Son,</hi> we have this Parable, <hi rend="margSglQuotes">This is as when a certain King was diſpleaſed with the Inhabitants of a great City, the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens went and made Supplication to the King's Son, to appeaſe his Father's diſpleaſure: The Son went and effectually prevailed with his Father to forgive them, and take them into his Favour; which the King's Son having ſignified to the Citizens, they addreſſed their Thanks to the King. The King bid them go and give Thanks to his Son, for had it not been for his Mediation, their City had been deſtroyed.</hi> This is that which is ſaid, <hi>Kiſs the Son;</hi> and it may be well for the Doctor if he would go and do likewiſe.</p>
               <p>It is not good to make ſport of holy Things, and droll on the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of our Salvation, comparing them to Fables, and this in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Phraſe, ridiculing the Peace of God, as paſſing all underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the Meritorious Death of our Saviour to the Preſcriptions or Juggles of a Quack, as if Faith in the Power and Merits of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, were as vain as the Opinions of the Mobile concerning an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyrick; yet we read of great Miracles wrought by Faith in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt.</p>

But was not this a Myſtery hid from that Nation until Chriſt and his Apoſtles revealed it: wiſer Men than the Doctor do rightly admire ſome Secrets in Nature, which when their Cauſes and Natures are diſcovered, very ignorant Men may apprehend: this the Doctor ſays to ſhew, <hi>That it is ſo far from being an honour, that it is rather a defect:</hi> As if there were no difficulty in Matters of Faith, and the Myſtery of Godlineſs mentioned by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Timothy,</hi> viz. <hi>God
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59637:55"/> manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> were no harder to be underſtood, than that My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery which had been ſo clearly revealed, <hi>The admiſſion of the Gentiles to a fellowſhip with the Jews.</hi> This is to ſerve another Hypotheſis of his, <hi>That we are not bound to believe, what we cannot underſtand by our Reaſon;</hi> and ſo to invalidate our belief of the Union of the Divine and Humane Nature in Chriſt: for ſaith the Doctor, <hi>p.</hi> 32. <hi>col.</hi> 1. <hi>If we will needs enquire into the Myſteries of Chriſt's Divinity and Incarnation, we ſhall find our Underſtandings no leſs confounded by the brightneſs of the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, than our Eyes are by the Sun, and of this the Holy Ghost warns us, not only by a careful ſilence concerning our Lord's Genealogy, but by expreſs Types and Propheſies, concerning its inſcrutability:</hi> So that by the Doctor's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, neither our Knowledge, nor our Faith, have any thing to do about the Divinity (he will not call it the Deity) of our Saviour, or his Incarnation, it matters not whether we know or believe any thing concerning either.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not charge the Dr. with any thing that he hath not expreſly ſaid; and therefore do acknowledge that what he ſpeaks of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, falls not under our debate; but I know that the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay, that there is no firmer footing for the Doctrine of the Trinity in the holy Scripture, than for Tranſubſtantiation; and the <hi>Socinians</hi> at <hi>Alba Julia,</hi> in a Treatiſe printed 1568. ſay thus, <hi>Whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believes the Pope to be Antichriſt, doth truly believe the Popiſh Trinity, Infant Baptiſm, and other Popiſh Sacraments to be the Doctrines of Devils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when I conſider that the <hi>Naked Goſpel</hi> is bereaved of this Doctrine, and intended not ſo much againſt the Doctrine and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments retained in that Church, as againſt what is maintained in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I ſubmit it to the Judgment of others, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe following expreſſions of the Authors, do not reflect on the Doctrine of our Church, when he ſpeaks of a pack of impertinent Myſteries, <hi>p.</hi> 58. <hi>col.</hi> 2. <hi>And that</hi> Mahomet <hi>among all his Whimſies, hath nothing comparable to it,</hi> p. 59. col. 1. <hi>And that the</hi> Athanaſian <hi>Doctrine may be numbred with the</hi> Papal, <hi>and of the Contradictions which are in the one, as well as in the other.</hi>

And ſuch was that Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.10. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.6. which was not made known to the Sons of Men in other Ages, as it was revealed to the Apoſtles and Prophets by the Spirit, <hi>(viz.)

That God created all things by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Crellius,</hi> Heb. 1. v. 10.</note> which though frequently aſſerted in the Scripture, as <hi>Col.</hi> 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the <hi>Socinians</hi> utterly deny; nor can they apprehend what is that Righteouſneſs which is by Faith, as oppoſed to that which is by the Law, or to our Doctor's <hi>Natural Faith:</hi> but the Doctor tells us of another Myſtery, little leſs than a Contradiction, as <hi>p.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2. viz. <hi>The Patriarchs knew only the Fathers:</hi> yet <hi>Abraham</hi> had the knowledge of Chriſt; and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſays, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake of him, and the Doctor affirms the ſame. That <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake of <hi>Christ, Deut.</hi> 30.12. for the Doctor ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 41. <hi>c.</hi> 1. that the Apoſtle applied that place to Chriſt: <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thy heart, that God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was not ſo much in diſlike of the Popiſh Myſteries, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ſo often rejects whatever is above human Reaſon, under that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as in diſlike of the Doctrine of the Trinity, and the Eternal Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of our Saviour, of which he ſpeaking, <hi>p.</hi> 34. <hi>c.</hi> 1. ſays, If you underſtand not this, you muſt not wonder, at leaſt not gain-ſay it, for it is a Myſtery which Reaſon cannot fathom, and therefore muſt be rejected as one of the Packs of Impertinent Myſteries, <hi>p.</hi> 58. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>The Doctor that writes ſo myſtically himſelf, ſhould not be ſo much diſpleaſed, if he meet with ſome Myſteries in other Writings, eſpecially in the Scripture, wherein, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> obſerves of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, <hi>There are ſome things hard to be underſtood, and will not be fully explained till</hi> Elias <hi>come.</hi> And indeed as Naked as his Goſpel is, it is darkned with ſo many obſcure miſts, and ſubtle inſinuations, that it will appear to ſome of his moſt diligent Readers, to be one continued Myſtery of Iniquity.</p>
               <p>It is a ſorry ſhift, which <hi>Sandius,</hi> and others that write againſt the Trinity, make to excuſe themſelves; for thus <hi>Sandius</hi> pleads, ſee his Appendix, <hi>p.</hi> 107. <hi>That he wrote his Book on behalf of the Proteſtants, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59637:56"/> the Papiſts to convince them that the Scripture is the only Rule of Faith, becauſe they could not prove the chiefeſt Articles of their Faith,</hi> (viz.) <hi>the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Conſubſtantiality and Coequality from the Tradition of the Fathers of the three firſt Ages.</hi> In this our Doctor follows <hi>Sandius,</hi> and would perſwade us to renounce the Doctrine of the Trinity, becauſe it is a Popiſh Doctrine. See more of this in another Epiſtle of <hi>Sandius,</hi> p. 261. <hi>I have proved,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the whole World in the fourth Age was</hi> Arian, <hi>and the</hi> Arians <hi>enjoyed Temporal Felicity, and wrought Miracles, to ſhew againſt the Papiſts, that theſe are not marks of the true Church: I reckoned diverſe Councils of the</hi> Arians <hi>who condemned the Catholick Faith, to ſhew that we ought not to depend on their Determinations in Matters of Faith, but on Scripture only: I have ſhewn that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath honoured many</hi> Arians <hi>that were of very evil lives, as Saints, to ſhew you what manner of Saints the Papiſts do Invocate by the Authority of the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All this is right: but when the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of his Book is to ſhew that the Doctrine of <hi>Arius</hi> denying the Godhead of Chriſt, and making him a Creature, is more conſonant to Scripture and Antiquity, than that of the Trinity in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is to condemn all other Churches that maintain the ſame Doctrine; for to this purpoſe tends that which remains in the Third Enquiry, concerning the Papiſts, who do impoſe new Articles of Faith, and ſet their Traditions and Decrees in an equal rank with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and ſometimes above them, with a <hi>Nonobſtante</hi> to Chriſt's own Inſtitutions, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> do by their <hi>Reaſon:</hi> let them therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute the Caſe with each other, and let <hi>Baal</hi> plead for himſelf: He cannot wound the Church of <hi>England</hi> through their ſides, unleſs he can prove the Doctrine of the Trinity to be a Popiſh Tradition; which he doth more than intimate, and herein he would do them more ſervice than any of their Champions, by proving Popery to be more ancient than the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am now come to the Concluſion of the Author, who ſhuts up his <hi>Naked Goſpel</hi> as generally the <hi>Socinians</hi> do, with a Plea for Toleration to all that confeſs the Lord Jeſus, and believe that God raiſed him from the Dead, though they leave him as Naked a Lord as the Doctor hath left the Goſpel, robbing him of his Eternity and Deity, and that Honour and Worſhip which on thoſe conſiderations are due to him, our Faith in his Name, Obedience to his Commands, a devout uſe of his Holy Sacraments; and ſo turn <hi>Turks, Jews,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> (as ſome <hi>Engliſh Socinians</hi> have done) <hi>Quakers,</hi> and live above Ordinances, ſatisfying themſelves with a Chriſt within them, and a <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Naked Goſpel,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> in a <hi>Socinian</hi> Tract hath done. This he calls
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59637:56"/> giving Faith its due Bounds, by impriſoning it and diſmembring it, ſeparating Obedience and Love, which are inſeparable from Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Faith.</p>
               <p>And as for Love, ſaith he, <hi>we must give it its due boundleſneſs even to them that love not, but deny and bid open defiance to the Godhead of Christ, to whom the Apoſtle denounceth</hi> Anathema. I wiſh heartily the Doctor had ſhewn more Charity to the Church of Chriſt in general, than to think and ſpeak of them as guilty of Idolatry in all Ages; for ſo are they that give Divine Worſhip to a Creature, and that he who ſtiles himſelf a Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> would not defame her as tainted with Popiſh (becauſe ſhe holds the <hi>Athanaſian</hi>) Doctrine, (for he calls that and the <hi>Nicene their Creeds,</hi> and our Litany <hi>their Litany</hi>) and ſo becoming a Papiſt to the Papiſts; and it's much better to be an <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Papiſt, than an <hi>Arian</hi> or <hi>Socinian</hi> Heretick.</p>
               <p>The Doctor tells us in the Vindication, <hi>p.</hi> 7. of his intention to have preſented his <hi>Naked Goſpel</hi> to the Convocation, that they might be induced to enlarge their Charity, at a time when all the Chriſtian World expected it from them: And was all the Chriſtian World once more become <hi>Arians,</hi> that they ſhould become Diſciples to his <hi>Naked Goſpel,</hi> I cannot conceive what compliance the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor could preſume of from that Convocation; he well knows their Prolocutor was the ſame that agreed ſhortly after to the burning of it in the Convocation at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and doubtleſs both he and the ſeveral Members would have had the ſame Reſentment of it at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as the <hi>Oxford</hi> Convocation had, <hi>When therefore we ſee a Viper riſing out of the Fires of</hi> Oxford, <hi>and hiſſing,</hi> p. 5. <hi>That the Hereſie lay not in the Book, but in the Concluſion; he deſerves to be ſhaken into the Fire again, for the impotent Creature doth not only hiſs at the miſtaken Author of</hi> Nolumus leges Angliae mutari, <hi>but on the whole Convocation, for their ſtiffneſs to their Conſtitutions; whoſe very Authors</hi> (ſays he in the Concluſion) <hi>were they now living, and true to their own reaſon, must be willing to aboliſh them.</hi> This is the Doctor's enlarged Charity to the deceaſed Compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of our Liturgy, that they would have done as he deſireth, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> removing the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creeds; the Litany, Doxology, and I know not what Conſtitutions beſides; the Inſtitutions of our Saviour, (to wit) the two Sacraments, Baptiſm and the Euchariſt, the ends whereof this Doctor with the <hi>Socinians</hi> doth utterly deſtroy, and retains them only as Rites and Badges of an outward Profeſſion of a <hi>Naked Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us enquire wherein this enlarged Charity of the Doctor's doth conſiſt: Charity is either the love of God, or of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; Now firſt, our love to God ought to bear proportion with the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59637:57"/> love he hath beſtowed on us; of which the Apoſtle, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. ſaith, <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> And Ver. 17. <hi>That the world by him might be ſaved.</hi> The World then without Chriſt was in a loſt and periſhing condition; God had for Sin ſhut them up under a ſentence of Condemnation; and it was his infinite Goodneſs and Wiſdom to contrive the Means of our Salvation, ſuch as might reconcile us to himſelf; to which end he thought this the fitteſt, to ſend his only begotten Son into the World <hi>to dye for our ſins, the just for the unjust, making him to be ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him:</hi> of this love the Apoſtle with admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſays, <hi>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath ſhewn to us,</hi> &amp;c. If God had only ſent a Prophet, a Man of God, to make a fuller De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his Will, this had not been a reaſon of ſo great Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but when he ſent his only begotten Son, that was one with the Father, <hi>and laid help on him that was mighty, able to ſave us to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, being God and Man;</hi> this deſerves the <hi>Sic So,</hi> and the <hi>Ecce Behold,</hi> and our admiration, <hi>What manner of Love;</hi> had he been the Son of God only by a miraculous Conception, which freed him from Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Corruption; had he only lived a Holy Life, and left us a good Example; had he only died to confirm the truth of his Doctrine, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay, the Birth of St. <hi>John Baptist,</hi> his auſtere Life and Death might come near to all this. The Gift therefore here ſpoken of, muſt be ſuch as became the Infinite Goodneſs of God; ſuch as might reconcile his Love to us, with his Love to his Juſtice; ſuch as might be ſufficient to ſatisfie for the Sins of all that ſhould believe in his Son, and obey the Commands of God by him: Which now is the greater Obligation of our Love to God, to believe (as I have ſaid) the <hi>Socinians</hi> do, or as the Catholicks, <hi>That God ſent his only Begotten,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>his Eternal Son, the Wonderful the Mighty GOD, to ſatisfie for our Sins, to inſtruct us in all things that concern the Glory of God, and our own Salvation; to hear our Prayers, and relieve all our Neceſſities; to ſanctifie our Souls, and make us Partakers of the Divine Nature, by the operation of the Spirit of Grace.</hi> This is Love, and this the Gift that God beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on us through his Infinite Love; and in ſome proportion we ought ſo to love God as he firſt loved us: And to think of, and eſteem of this Gift leſs than what the Scripture hath valued it at, is not rightly to apprehend his Love, or our infinite Obligations to make ſuitable Returns.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to our Love to Chriſt; if he were only a Man that taught us the Will of God, ſo did the Apoſtles; if he died only to confirm his Doctrine, and give us an Example of Conſtancy and Patience, ſo have
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59637:57"/> many Martyrs done: But <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.7, 8. <hi>God commended his love to us in that while we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us;</hi> and had he only died for us, and not been able to riſe again, and to take up his life as well as to lay it down; had he not deſtroyed all the Enemies of our Salvation, and aſcended to Heaven, having all Power committed to him, we might argue as the Apoſtle doth, <hi>If Christ be not riſen;</hi> and if he be not the Eternal Son of God, to make Interceſſion for us, and to ſend the Holy Ghoſt to ſanctifie us, then is our Preaching vain, and our Faith is vain, and we are yet in our Sins; but now we may ſing ou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then for his Love to the Holy Spirit of God; it is too well known that the <hi>Socinians</hi> deny his Deity, and ſay, That the Holy Spirit is nothing ſeparate from the Word; ſo that we need not to Baptize in his Name, to praiſe him in our Doxology, or to pray to him, <hi>Come Holy Ghost Eternal God,</hi> &amp;c. Our natural Reaſon and Faith in God, makes the aſſiſtance of any other Spirit needleſs; and why then ſhould we wait on the Spirit of God any longer, or believe that God will give any other Spirit to them that ask it? Is there no other Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit but that which works in the Children of Diſobedience? Are not ſome Souls an Habitation of God through the Spirit? Read we not of the Spirit of the Son, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. that helps our Infirmities? Do we not read of the divers Gifts of the Spirit, and that it is Chriſt's Vice-Roy, as I may ſay, to preſide over his Church to the World's end? And is there no Love, no Obedience due to his Spirit, but we muſt joyn with the <hi>Socinians</hi> to pluck the Holy Ghoſt from his Throne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for his enlarged Charity to his Brethren, what love doth he manifeſt to the Church of God, that hath been founded on this Rock of the Confeſſion of St. <hi>Peter, Thou art Chriſt the Son of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God;</hi> when by his Principles they are proclaimed to be Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as worſhipping a Creature beſides the Creator; and giving him and the Holy Spirit, which by his Maxims are not God by nature, the ſame Divine Honour which is due to God only.</p>
               <p>And as to the Church of <hi>England</hi> particularly, it hath been decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red how contrary his Opinions are to her avowed Doctrines, more eſpecially his Charity to the Convocation of the Clergy at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> whom he condemns to be too ſtiff to their Conſtitutions, when he ſays, <hi>All the World expected a Condeſcention from them,</hi> is not very large. It was no very good Opinion that he conceived of them, when he thought to preſent his <hi>Naked Goſpel</hi> to them, as if they would have faln in love with its Nakedneſs. And the truth is, they ſaw ſo many
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59637:58"/> ſhameful and ſcandalous Pamphlets demanding Alterations in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions and Doctrines, and a Toleration of Latitudinarian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that though they were willing to make ſome moderate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, yet when they perceived there would be no end of demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Alterations as they could not conſent to, they thought it fit to maintain their ground, and not give way to unreaſonable Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals; ſuch as theſe which the Doctor now makes, for a Toleration of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Hereſie.</p>
               <p>As for his Charity to the <hi>Oxford</hi> Convocations, the Reflections made on them in his Vindication, which hath been already conſidered, do diſcover that his Charity begins and ends at home, and is confined only to Men of his own Perſwaſion. I think I do not conjecture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, if I ſay, that he hath the ſame enlarged Charity for us as <hi>Smalcius</hi> had, who concludes his Book <hi>De Divinitate Chriſti</hi> thus: <hi>I doubt not to affirm confidently, That none of thoſe who believe Jeſus Chriſt to be God of himſelf, and to have Divine Power, can by any means have certain hope of Eternal Life, by vertue of his Opinion concerning Christ.</hi> And ſuch is the Charity of this Author to all that profeſs Chriſt to be their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and ſay, <hi>Thou art the King of Gory, O Chriſt: Thou art the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Son of the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this were the Doctor's deſign in writing his <hi>Naked Goſpel,</hi> I ſhall conform to the Apoſtle who enjoyns, That <hi>if an Angel from Heaven ſhould teach what is ſo oppoſite to the Goſpel, which the Church in all Ages hath received and believed, he deſerves an</hi> Anathema.</p>
               <p>Thus at laſt we are like to ſee a thorough Reformation of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Goſpel of our Lord and Saviour, even ſuch as we ſaw of the once Flouriſhing Church of <hi>England,</hi> under the Government of the moſt Religious King and Martyr <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt: It was reformed firſt by a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Parliament, which took away her <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Liturgy;</hi> then by an <hi>Independent Army,</hi> that devoured her <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Revenues;</hi> then by an <hi>Inſpired General,</hi> which brought in a Toleration of all ſorts of <hi>Enthuſiaſts;</hi> and after ſundry Revolutions, by a <hi>Naked Rump,</hi> which if God alone had not prevented, it would have left us all in Confuſion.</p>
               <p>Thus the Goſpel which ſpread ſo far and wide under the Miniſtry of our Saviour and his Apoſtles, was firſt reformed by a Juncture of <hi>Gnoſticks, Nicolaitans,</hi> and <hi>Ebionites,</hi> who mixt the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Opinions and Obſervations with the pure Ordinances of the Goſpel, and would equal <hi>Moſes</hi> with Chriſt: then by the <hi>Samoſatenians</hi> and <hi>Arians,</hi> who robbed him of that which he thought no Robbery, to aſſume to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to be equal with God. Then by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that great Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, who preferred himſelf above our Saviour, drawing all Sects into
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59637:58"/> a Body under himſelf. And now, after various Revolutions, by the <hi>Naked Goſpel,</hi> which proclaims our Saviour a meer Man, as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and other Meſſengers of God were: to whom therefore ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready do, and the reſt of the <hi>Socinians</hi> ought by their Principles, to deny any Religious Worſhip; which by their own Confeſſion is due to God only, and to no Creature whatſoever. And who can foreſee with what Viperous Monſters the <hi>Naked Goſpel</hi> is now pregnant! which begin to eat through the Bowels of that Church wherein they have been nouriſhed; and proclaim Liberty to all ſort of Hereſies and Blaſphemies, againſt the Son of God, and the Spirit of Grace, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Trampling under foot the Son of God, and doing deſpite to the Spirit of Grace.</hi> When one Pamphlet proclaims the Holy Ghoſt Dethron'd, another, <hi>The Triple God Buried,</hi> and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity is a Popiſh Antichriſtian Diabolical Doctrine; theſe dreadful Alarms from the Bottomleſs Pit, ſhould awaken all good Chriſtians, unanimouſly to Invoke the Ever Bleſſed Trinity to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and plead its own Cauſe, againſt ſuch as daily Blaſpheme them.</p>
               <p>The loud Blaſphemies of theſe <hi>Philiſtines</hi> againſt not only the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> of God, but the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hath called me forth to bid Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to this <hi>Goliah,</hi> though armed only with a Stone and a Sling: not doubting but there are many Worthies in our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who will appear, and do wonderful things: All that I intended was to diſcover where this Adverſary lay hid, under the uſual Diſguiſe of the Old Serpent, that moſtly appears as an <hi>Angel of Light,</hi> that he may with leſs ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion effect his Works of Darkneſs: and I doubt not, but the Church of Chriſt hath ſtill ſuch good Angels miniſtring to her, before whom ſuch Angels of Satan ſhall flee, and fall as Lightning.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rabbies</hi> ſay, <hi>That on the Stone wherewith</hi> David <hi>ſlew</hi> Goliah, <hi>the Characters of the</hi> Meſſiah <hi>were engraven.</hi> I ſhall ſling a Stone or two in the Name of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> our Bleſſed Saviour, againſt thoſe <hi>Philiſtines</hi> that have blaſphemed that Name, and commit the ſucceſs of them to the All-diſpoſing Providence of God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt Argument that I ſhall urge, is the Harmony of the Old and New Teſtament, which ſpeaks of the Deity of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and apply it to our Saviour.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is drawn from the Doctrine and Faith of ſuch eminent Fathers and Martyrs as ſuffered for that Faith.</p>
               <p>The third from thoſe Judgments of God executed on thoſe who in their ſeveral Ages openly oppoſed that Faith, which may ſerve as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to deter others from tempting Chriſt, leſt they be deſtroyed as thoſe were, of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.9. From which
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59637:59"/> Premiſes we may rightly infer an Equality of Nature and Power, in the Father and the Son, and conclude the ſame Honour and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip due to both. When <hi>Arcadius,</hi> an <hi>Arian</hi> Emperor, aſſumed his Son to a Partnerſhip in the Empire, the good Biſhop (St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> as I remember) addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Arcadius,</hi> humbled himſelf with all due Obeyſance, but took no notice of his Son <hi>Honorius,</hi> at which the Emperor manifeſting his diſpleaſure, the good Biſhop took occaſion to tell him, <hi>That if he were offended at the diſreſpect ſhewn to his Son, he might conſider, that the God of Heaven might be more juſtly diſpleaſed with them that neglected to honour his Son; which I leave you to apply.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some <hi>Socinians</hi> deny our Saviour any Worſhip, and others grant him only a <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, ſuch an inferior Honor as the Papiſts do their Saints, not that Divine Worſhip which properly belongs to the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>It is generally agreed by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> to make the Holy Sripture Judge of this great Controverſy, concerning the Godhead of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; but they would have Reaſon to be Judge of the ſence of the Scripture: and to this we would appeal, if they would not ſeek little Evaſions from Particles, and Criticiſms of their own inventions, againſt the plain Letter of the Scripture; for <hi>Smaltſius,</hi> one of their beſt Champions, ſays, <hi>Ludum &amp; jocum è Scripturis facere pronunciant qui abſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que neceſſitate a</hi>

               <p>What is it but to Play with the Scriptures, after all theſe expreſs ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of his Eternal Deity, to deny it? And becauſe the beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Scripture is to be found in the Harmony and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, or the Analogy of the Old and New Teſtament; the beſt Confutation of the <hi>Socinian,</hi> and conſequently the beſt Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the received Opinion of the Eternal Deity of the Son of God, may be demonſtrated from thoſe places in the Old Teſtament, which ſpeaking of our Saviour as the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and attributing to him the very Eſſence, Names, and Properties of the Supreme God, are in the New Teſtament appropriated to our Bleſſed Saviour, who therefore in divers places appeals to the Propheſies that went before concerning him, in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Prophets;</hi> to them we will appeal, and ſearch the Scripture, becauſe they teſtify of him.</p>
               <p>At the Transfiguration of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. it is ſaid, <hi>There appeared together with Peter, James and John, Moſes and Elias; Ut lex &amp; Prophetae cum Evangelio congruentes ſempeternum Dei filium quem an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciaverant revelarent:</hi> That the Law and the Prophets conſpiring with Chriſt and his Evangeliſts, might declare the Eternal Son of God whom they had foretold, and were to preach to the World. See St. <hi>Ambroſe ad Gratian.</hi> 59. and St. <hi>Aug. ad Catechum.</hi> c. 6.</p>
               <p>This the Author of the <hi>Naked Goſpel</hi> might have obſerved from his own Quotation of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>'s words to <hi>Triphon</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi>

                  <hi>I ſhall not prove,</hi> ſaith <hi>Juſt. Mar. that Chriſt is God, otherwiſe than by proving that this is the Chriſt, and that it was foretold that he ſhould be ſuch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame courſe doth our Country-man <hi>Bradwardine</hi> take, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Trinity, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 29. he confidently affirms, <hi>That there is not one ſubſtantial Article of the Chriſtian Faith, which God had not ſolemnly foretold and revealed by his Prophets, and that in ſo plain a manner that if any Philoſopher, as a Lover and Enquirer after Truth, ſhould duly conſider what is written in the Old Teſtament, he muſt become a Chriſtian:</hi> As he obſerves many of the Fathers who were ſuch Philoſophers, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to be.</p>
               <p>Such were <hi>Juſtine Martyr, Clemens Alex. Tertull. Origen,</hi> and many others, who from the Schools of <hi>Plato,</hi> and ſome Traditions which he had received from the ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> were prepared, upon reading of the Old Teſtament, to imbrace the Doctrine of our Saviour and his Apoſtles, becauſe they agreed with the Goſpel preached by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hornbeck</hi> in his Sum of Controverſies, tells us, <hi>That the Diſciples of</hi> Mahomet <hi>do confeſs, that if they believed St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s Epiſtles to be Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:59637:60"/> (as we do) <hi>they must believe the Divinity of Chriſt:</hi> Therefore in their Diſputes with Chriſtians concerning the Deity of Chriſt, they decline the Authority of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, ſaying, <hi>They were adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the Chriſtians.</hi> That Teſtimony which <hi>Pliny</hi> gives to <hi>Trajan</hi> concerning the Chriſtians, that they did <hi>carmen dicere Chriſto tanquam Deo;</hi> ſing Praiſes to Chriſt as their God: coming from an Heathen is the more firm, and it cannot be denied.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtians who ſuffered under the Heathen Perſecutors, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their belief of the Eternal Deity of our Saviour; for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of them was, <hi>Nega Deum incende Teſtamentum;</hi> Deny your God, burn your Teſtaments: which implys, that they believed that Chriſt was God, and that their Teſtaments bore witneſs to the ſame. Yet their anſwer was, <hi>Chriſtianus ſum Chriſtum verum Deum agnoſco &amp; adoro;</hi> I am a Chriſtian, I acknowledge and worſhip Chriſt as the true God. See the <hi>Tripartite Hiſtory of the Perſecution by the</hi> Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals.</p>
               <p>And now I ſhall compare thoſe Teſtimonies in the Old and New Teſtament which do prove, that our Saviour was the Eternal Son of God, and only premiſe, that if any one of thoſe Scriptures which ſpeak of the Eternal God in the Old Teſtament, be rightly applied to our Saviour in the New, that then he is that Eternal God: To this therefore I apply myſelf, deſiring the Reader to bear in mind, that whatever from the Old Teſtament is in the New Teſtament ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to Chriſt by himſelf, or his Apoſtles, is as true, and to be believed as much as any other part of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The firſt Scripture that I ſhall compare is that of <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 9.1. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.1. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25, 26. from which places it is thus argued:</p>
               <p>He to whom the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were a peculiar People, whom by the hands of <hi>Moſes</hi> he brought out of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> for whoſe ſake <hi>Moſes</hi> choſe to ſuffer affliction with them, rather than to enjoy the Crown of <hi>Pharoah:</hi> He was the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but our Saviour Chriſt was he whoſe peculiar People they were, therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is applyed to Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24. By Faith <hi>Moſes</hi> refuſed to be called the Son of <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Daughter, and choſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of Sin for a ſeaſon; eſteeming the Reproach of Chriſt greater Riches than the Treaſures of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> Here the affliction of the People of God is called the reproach of Chriſt, his therefore was that People, and them he brought out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and therefore he is that God. The Apoſtle St. <hi>Jude,</hi> v. 5. ſpeaks to this purpoſe, <hi>That the Lord,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which in the vulgar <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> is rendred Jeſus, <hi>having ſaved the people out of Aegypt, afterward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59637:60"/> them that believed not.</hi> Compare <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; the ſcepter of thy kingdom is a right ſcepter:</hi> He whoſe Throne is for ever and ever is God; but Chriſt's Throne is for ever and ever, therefore he is God. Both theſe Propoſitions are expreſs Scripture.</p>
               <p>The next Scripture ſhall be that of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 7.14. <hi>A Virgin ſhall conceive and bring forth a ſon, and his name ſhall be called Emanuel;</hi> compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.23. <hi>All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> (viz.) Iſai. 7.14.) <hi>by the Prophet, ſaying, Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive and bring forth a ſon, and thou ſhalt call his name Emanuel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is an Objection caſt in our way which muſt be removed, before we proceed: <hi>Object.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. <hi>The Angel of the Lord which appeard to Joſeph, told him that he ſhould call his name Jeſus;</hi> How then was this of the Prophet fulfilled, <hi>They ſhall call his name E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That Names are of two ſorts, ſome for diſtinction of Perſons, as proper Names, others ſerve for Deſcription of the Nature or Offices of a Perſon; in the firſt reſpect he is called Jeſus, a Saviour, there being no other Saviour but he; for there is <hi>no other name given to man, whereby he may be ſaved.</hi> The other of <hi>Emanuel,</hi> deſcribes his Nature, what he ſhould be, viz. <hi>God with us, God manifeſted in the fleſh:</hi> So the ſame Prophet, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9.6. <hi>His name ſhall be called Wonderful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. <hi>This is his name whereby he ſhall be called, The Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. <hi>That which is born of thee ſhall be called the Son of God.</hi> And it is obſerved, that both the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Old Teſtament, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the New, do ſignify to be, as well as to be called. <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Tertullian,</hi> and other Ancients, ſolved this Objection made by the <hi>Jews, Venit Emanuel quia venit quod Emanuel ſignificat;</hi> The <hi>Emanuel</hi> is come, becauſe he is come who was ſignified by that name, <hi>God with us;</hi> not only to reconcile us to God, but to be God Incarnate.</p>
               <p>The Argument then is this: <hi>Emanuel</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, God in the Divine Eſſence; Chriſt is <hi>Emanuel,</hi> therefore he is God in the Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. That the word God is to be underſtood of the moſt High God, the <hi>Socinians</hi> grant: But <hi>Crellius</hi> objects, that the word <hi>eſt</hi> ſhould be added, and ſo the meaning is, <hi>God is with us.</hi> But when St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> expounds the name without that Addition, there is great Reaſon to reject it: and if that had been the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt, in the name as given by the Prophet, St. <hi>Matthew</hi> would not have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, it being of great concern to the Glory of God, and the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Church. The meaning of the Name therefore is not <hi>God is with us,</hi> (i. e.) as ſays <hi>Crellius,</hi> to help and aſſiſt us: but Chriſt
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59637:61"/> is <hi>God with us;</hi> for the name <hi>Emanuel</hi> being put into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto Chriſt, it will appear whether St. <hi>Matthew</hi> or <hi>Crellius</hi> gives the beſt Interpretation: This is St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s ſence, <hi>Chriſt is God with us; (i. e.)</hi> God and Man. And this is <hi>Crellius</hi> his Nonſence, <hi>Chriſt God with Man is.</hi> Is not this to add to, and alter the ſence of the Scripture?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Malach.</hi> 3.1. compared with <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.10. <hi>Behold, I ſend my Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and he ſhall prepare the way before me; and the Lord whom ye ſeek ſhall ſuddenly come to his temple:</hi> This is he ſaith St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> of whom it is written, <hi>Behold I ſend my Meſſenger before thy face,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is agreed that <hi>John the Baptist</hi> was this Meſſenger ſpoken of; and the Argument is this: He before whom <hi>John Baptist</hi> was to be ſent to prepare his way, is the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but Chriſt is he before whom <hi>John Baptist</hi> was to be ſent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore Chriſt is the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Propoſition is proved by <hi>Malachy,</hi> where he that ſpeaks is called <hi>the God of Iſrael, and Lord of Hoſts:</hi> This <hi>Socinus</hi> grants. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Propoſition is proved by St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> applying it to Chriſt, <hi>This is he of whom it is written,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Sum of what is objected to this Argument is, <hi>That the Text in</hi> Malachy <hi>is corrupted, and inſtead of reading,</hi> He ſhall prepare the way before me; <hi>it ſhould be read,</hi> He ſhall prepare the way before thee. But then how comes it to paſs, that no one Copy of that of <hi>Malachy,</hi> or this in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> reads otherwiſe than we do? He will not ſay they are all corrupted; and we ſay none are corrupted. But they ask, <hi>How is it that what</hi> Malachy <hi>reads in the firſt Perſon,</hi> He ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way before me, <hi>Chriſt renders in the ſecond Perſon,</hi> He ſhall prepare the way before thee?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Objection will improve our Argument; for when <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy</hi> ſays, <hi>He ſhall prepare the way before me;</hi> which is ſpoken of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and our Saviour renders it, <hi>He ſhall prepare the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee,</hi> and applys it to himſelf, this proves that Chriſt was that God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> who ſpake in <hi>Malachy;</hi> and ſo proves the Identity of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God the Father and the Son. Moreover, by comparing this place of <hi>Malachy</hi> with the Interpretation which our Saviour gives of it in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> we infer from <hi>Malachy</hi> the Unity of the Eſſence of the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and Chriſt; and from that in <hi>Matthew</hi> we learn a diſtinction of Perſons, which had not been ſo intelligible, if Chriſt had not changed the firſt Perſon, or the word <hi>my,</hi> into the ſecond Perſon, or the word <hi>thy,</hi> in St. <hi>Matth.</hi>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59637:61"/> Argument is this: He that is to be worſhipped and ſerved with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip is the God of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Chriſt is to be worſhipped and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with Divine Worſhip, therefore Chriſt is the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> The firſt Propoſition is expreſs Scripture: the ſecond is granted by the <hi>Socinians;</hi> therefore the Concluſion is undeniable.</p>

Schich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingius</hi> is of another mind, and ſays, <hi>That this particle</hi> only, <hi>when it is ſpoken of God, doth not exclude thoſe that depend on God in the thing ſpoken of.</hi> Now if <hi>Crellius</hi> ſpeaks the truth, then Chriſt is not to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, becauſe the word <hi>only</hi> excludes him: If <hi>Schichtingius</hi> ſpeaks the truth, then Chriſt may be the true God, becauſe the word <hi>only</hi> doth not exclude him. <hi>Volkelius</hi> ſays, <hi>That ſeeing Chriſt is ſubordinate to God, in worſhipping of Chriſt we worſhip God who hath given him ſo great Power and Dignity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is againſt the Command that excludes all others, for if Chriſt be a Man, wholly diſtinguiſhed from the Father by nature, if he be a Creature, though honoured with the name of God, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have been, this Precept forbids us to worſhip him, as much as to worſhip any other Creature.</p>
               <p>That which they farther object, <hi>That this Precept belongs to the Old Teſtament, and was given before Chriſt had a being,</hi> is abſurd; for if there be any Moral Precepts of perpetual Obligation, this is one: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, when Chriſt uſed this Precept, he was then in being; and by a Voice from Heaven was proclaimed to be the Son of God. So that the <hi>Socinians</hi> muſt wholly deny Divine Worſhip to Chriſt, or elſe are guilty of Idolatry, in worſhipping a Creature.</p>
               <p>The like Argument we have <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.8. where God declares, <hi>That he will not give his glory to another, (i. e.)</hi> the Praiſe, Adoration, and Worſhip which is due to him alone, may not be given to any other Angels or Men. The Argument is this: God will not give his Glory or Divine Worſhip to another; but he hath given it to Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt is not another.</p>
               <p>To this they ſay, <hi>That God intended by this Declaration to exclude Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Images, which are immediately expreſſed,</hi> Neither my praiſe to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Images; <hi>he doth not ſay, He will not give it to any who have their dependance on him, and are ſubordinate to him.</hi> As if the word <hi>another</hi> did exclude only Graven Images; or as if all other things had not their dependance on him, which yet are all excluded.</p>
               <p>And it is obſervable, that in this Chapter mention is made of Chriſt; ſo <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>I the Lord have called thee in righteouſneſs, and will hold
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59637:62"/> thy hand, and keep thee, and give thee for a covenant to the people, a light to the Gentiles;</hi> this is ſpoken of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.32. To open the blind Eyes, to bring out the Priſoners from the Priſon, and them that ſit in Darkneſs out of the Priſon-houſe; ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18.

               <p>The <hi>Socinians</hi> are not aſhamed to ſay, That <hi>this place is added by</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius, <hi>or ſome of his Perſwaſion;</hi> though not only the practice of the Apoſtles and the Primitive Fathers may evince the contrary; but it is read in all the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, the <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Aethiopick;</hi> and <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59637:64"/> Tertullian,</hi> and other Fathers have quoted and expounded this Text: and the <hi>Socinians</hi> retain it in their <hi>German</hi> Edition of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, <hi>An.</hi> 1630.</p>

               <p>There are many other Scriptures that confirm the Doctrine of the Trinity, in the Judgment of our Divines, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.26. <hi>When the Comforter is come, whom I will ſend from the Father;</hi> where we have the Father from whom, the Son by whom, and the Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt that is ſent.

So alſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.5, 6. <hi>And there are diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of gifts, but the ſame ſpirit and diverſities of adminiſtrations, but the ſame Lord, and there are diverſities of operations, but the ſame God;</hi> where we have three Perſons and but one God.</p>
               <p>It is evident from theſe and many other Scriptures, that by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the <hi>Arians,</hi> our Saviour had the Divine Attributes of Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence and Omniſcience communicated to him; and if theſe were imparted to him by his Father, it is not againſt reaſon that that other Attribute of Eternity might be alſo; for to be Omnipotent and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient, implies an Infinity as the properties of the Eternal God; nor can our Saviour be thought leſs than Infinite, when we believe that he hears the Prayers, ſearcheth the Hearts, and knows the Thoughts of all Men, and ſhall come to be the Judge of all, without which Attributes he could not judge rightly. The Creation and Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things do prove the ſame; for he that made all things is God: And ſo doth his being the only Law-giver, and the only Judge, and to qualifie him for theſe Offices he muſt be God; to bind our Conſciences to his Laws, and to judge righteous Judgment, And ſhall not the Judge of all the Earth judge righteouſly? which none can do but the Omniſcient and Omnipotent God.</p>

                  <hi>Eſtius,</hi> one of the beſt School-men, aſſerts, <hi>That no Creature can be ſo highly elevated, by a ſupernatural power, as to co-operate by way of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Inſtrument in the Creation, becauſe it is a property that belongs to ſuch an Inſtrument to have ſomething of its own, whereby to week diſpoſitive for the effecting of the Creation; Whence,</hi> he ſays, <hi>no Creature can be aſſumed to the power of Creation, as a Phyſical Inſtrument, the nature of that Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtill remaining.</hi> And nothing can be the cauſe of Creation, which hath not an infinite Power, becauſe by how much the Form to be produced is removed from the Power of Production, by ſo much a greater power is required in the Agent; ſo that for the production of ſomething out of nothing, there is required an infinite Power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the diſtance between ſomething and nothing is infinite: ſo that our Saviour being (as the Scripture affirms) the Creator of the World, he is alſo God over all, bleſſed for ever.</p>

Theſe Opinions, with an Antitheſis to them, <hi>Socinus</hi> preſents to <hi>Barthoreus</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> who had caſt <hi>David</hi> into Priſon, on the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Blandrata,</hi> (who would put it off on the <hi>Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatenians</hi> and other Sects, who thereupon accuſed one another of Craft, Treachery, and Cruelty) and being impriſoned in <hi>June,</hi> died in <hi>November</hi> following. During his Impriſonment he fell into great diſtraction through anguiſh of Spirit (through the juſt Judgment of God upon him, ſaith <hi>Socinus</hi>) and in his diſtraction cryed out, <hi>Behold, who do expect me to be their Companion in my Journey;</hi> and in this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful condition he expired. But his abominable Hereſies died not with him, for one <hi>Martyne Seidelius</hi> was over-run with this Leproſie, who gives this account of his Opinions: <hi>That the Doctrine of the</hi> Meſſias <hi>did not belong to him, for he was promiſed only to the</hi> Jews, <hi>as the promiſe of the good things of</hi> Canaan <hi>had been; ſo neither Circumciſion and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and Ceremonies appointed by</hi> Moſes <hi>do concern me, but the</hi> Jews <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on whom they were impoſed; neither were they the Worſhip of God, but an Introduction thereunto. The true Worſhip of God, which I call my Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is the Decalogue which is the Eternal and Immutable Will of God, which I call mine, becauſe it is given me by God, not by a Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but ingrafted in my mind from the Creation; and becauſe this Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Decalogue is much obſcured by the Corruption of Humane Nature and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59637:68"/> wicked Cuſtoms, I add a Vocal Decalogue to illuſtrate it, which Vocal Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue doth therefore belong to me and to all Men, becauſe it agrees with the Ingraven Decalogue, and is the ſame with it. This is my Opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the</hi> Meſſias, <hi>or the King promiſed; and this is the Religion which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly profeſs to you.</hi> Martyne Seidelius.

And in the ſeven Books which he wrote concerning the Errors of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſpeaking of the Eternal Generation of the Son, <hi>l.</hi> 1. he ſays, <hi>That then the Father ought to have a Spiritual Wife, or was an</hi> Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrodite, <hi>both Father and Mother; for the reaſon of the word permits not that any ſhould be called a Father without a Mother.</hi> His other Errors were, <hi>That the Subſtance of God was mutable, and was a part of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe.</hi> He denied the <hi>Deity of the Son and the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Mortality of the Soul;</hi> and that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a <hi>ridiculous Impoſtor,</hi> and the <hi>Church of</hi> Iſrael <hi>a Heard of Swine.</hi> He mentioned, ſaith <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> the Trinity to be a <hi>Deviliſh Phantaſm, and Satanical Illuſion,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove and hundred times.</p>
               <p>For theſe reaſons he was impriſoned by the Magiſtrates of <hi>Geneva;</hi> and that they might proceed judiciavily againſt him, they conſulted with the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Churches, who all approved of their intended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and ſentenced him to be Burnt, which Sentence was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly executed on him in <hi>Geneva,</hi> 1553. <hi>Bulling.

Both living and dead was in great repute and eſteem among the <hi>Socinians: Theophilus Nicolai</hi> calls him <hi>his Brother and Servant of the</hi> Meſſiah; <hi>What did not</hi> Michael Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetus, <hi>that learned Man and ſtout Defender of the Faith, ſuffer unjuſtly? Oſtorodus</hi> made an Apology for him; ſo did <hi>Voidovius.</hi> And <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf ſays, <hi>That he thought much more highly of Chriſt, than the</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans <hi>did, and in ſome things wrote againſt them.</hi> And when he was
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59637:68"/> brought to the Fire, he would not acknowledge the Eternal Son of God, but the Son of the Eternal God; for which they eſteemed him a Martyr.</p>
               <p>This ſort of Serpents have had their lurking Holes in this Nation, and have attempted to poyſon the People, but hitherto have been prevented as ſoon as they began to peep abroad; I know not what they might have done, had they found a Man of ſuch Learning and Confidence as our Author. In the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> to the great Grief and Scandal of the Proteſtant Martyrs, there were ſome that ſuffered for denying the Godhead of Chriſt: in the Year 1579, one <hi>Hamant</hi> was burnt in <hi>Norwich</hi> for denying the Deity of Chriſt: and in the Year 1588, one <hi>Kett</hi> ſuffered for the ſame Blaſphemy: In King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt his Reign, one <hi>Legate</hi> ſuffered for the ſame He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie. <hi>Sandius</hi> obſerves, <hi>p.</hi> 430. that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> complained with grief, <hi>That ſuch Monſters as the</hi> Arians <hi>were found in her Kingdom;</hi> whereof he gives an account, that ſome were executed in the Reigns of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>James</hi> the Firſt.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1579, there was printed at <hi>London</hi> an <hi>Arian</hi> Book, as <hi>Sandius,</hi> p. 430. called, <hi>The Articles of the Family of Love;</hi> and how deſervedly that Family was ſubverted for their debauched and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Practices, is ſufficiently known.</p>
               <p>In the late Troubles, when all Sects and Hereſies were permitted, this Gangreen began to ſpread; their attempts were on the weaker ſort of People, <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> many of whom were ſeduced by ſome ſuch Leaders as Mr. <hi>Beedle</hi> and <hi>Pen:</hi> And how far the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſpread, the Reader may ſee in <hi>Pagit</hi>'s <hi>Hireſiology,</hi> and in <hi>Edwards Gangrena;</hi> where there is ſo much Filth, as makes me forbear to rake it up.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And concerning the Doctrine of the Trinity, St. <hi>Chryſoſtome Hom.</hi> 4. on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> profeſſeth that he durſt not ſpeak of the Form of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and of the Creed, in which the Myſtery of the Holy Trinity is explained, <hi>I dare not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe of thoſe that are not yet initiated, who make the Expoſition more difficult, who compel us either not to ſpeak o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, or to diſcover Secrets to them; yet I will ſpeak of them as far as I am permitted, under Figures.</hi>

               <p>There is ſomething to this purpoſe in <hi>Soz.</hi> l. 1. c. 20. <hi>I thought</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to have ſet forth a Copy of the Creed, as neceſſary for the Demonſtration of our Faith, but when ſome of my Friends, pious Men, and well skilled in the knowledge of theſe things, perſwaded me that I ſhould keep in ſilence ſuch things as are fit for Prieſts only to ſpeak of, and for ſuch as are already initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to hear; I approved of their Counſel, becauſe it is very probable that ſome who are not yet initiated, may read theſe Books; wherefore I have hid, as much as I could, thoſe Secrets which ought to be concealed, acquainting the Reader with ſuch Decrees of the Council, which they ought not to be wholly ignorant of.</hi> And indeed we find that the Heathen, when they heard of the ſecret Doctrines of the Trinity, Sacraments, and Prayers of the Primitive Chriſtians, did make ſport of them, and ridicul'd them on their Theatres, and publick Plays; whereof we have an inſtance in <hi>Lucian</hi>'s <hi>Philopatris,</hi> or a Dialogue, wherein he repreſents a Chriſtian inſtructing an <hi>Ethnick,</hi> by whom he ought to ſwear, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear,</hi> ſays he, <hi>by the God that rules on high, the great immortal and immutable God, by the Son of the Father, and by the Spirit proceeding from the Father, one in three, and three in one; conceive this to be</hi> Jupiter <hi>your God.</hi> To which the <hi>Ethnick</hi> anſwers, <hi>I cannot apprehend what you ſay is one three, and three one.</hi> Thus alſo he ſcoffs at our Lord's Prayer, when the Heathen bids his Catechumen go and ſay the Prayer, beginning Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and end with a Song of many Names; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the Doxology. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> ſays in his Defence againſt <hi>Eutropius, That he never read any thing more ſtrong for the Opinion of the Trinity, than this of</hi> Lucian, <hi>he wrote in the time of</hi> Trajan.</p>

So that conſidering this Diſcipline which reſtrained many Ancients from publiſhing the whole Truth, and the diligence of the ſeveral Hereticks, to alter and expunge what was written againſt them, it is a wonderful Providence, that ſo many Authentick Teſtimones are preſerved.

               <p>The Epiſtle of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> written about the time of the Apoſtles, call Chriſt the Son of God, Lord of the whole World; by whom and for whom all things were made, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> by him as the Efficient, and for him as the Final Cauſe, which agreeth with the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. and cannot be ſaid of any but God without Blaſphemy, <hi>ſ.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 2. and in <hi>c.</hi> 5. of that Epiſtle, he ſays, <hi>That he who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew all things, foretold his People that he would take away the Heart of Stone, and give them a Heart of Fleſh, becauſe he was to appear (or be made manifest) in the Fleſh, and to dwell in us; for our Hearts,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are the holy Temple of the Lord.</hi>

                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That the Trinity is not to be divided into three Gods, nor the Dignity of it to be leſſened by the name of a Creature, but we are to believe in God the Father Almighty, and in Jeſus Chriſt his Son, and in the Holy Spirit.

               <p>Concerning the Eternal Generation of Chriſt, there is a plain ſence of the <hi>Anti-Nicene</hi> Fathers that will anſwer all the Objections made by the <hi>Arians</hi> againſt that Eternal Generation of Chriſt, and their Opinions that he was only the firſt begotten of the Creatures, being himſelf made in order to the making of the World; for they aſſert, <hi>That the Word did alway exist with his Father, but there was a prolation, emiſſion or application of the Son,</hi> ad exteriora, <hi>the Father in order to the Creation;</hi> and this is by ſome metaphorically called a Generation, not as if he then had a beginning; for God, as <hi>Athenagoras</hi> ſays, who is an Eternal Mind, had in himſelf his Eternal Word from Eternity, though the Energy or Operation of that Word appeard firſt in the Creation; in which ſence be calls the Word the firſt begotten, <hi>But ſuch</hi> (ſays he) <hi>as was not made but by whom all things were made.</hi> This one Diſtinction of the Word or Son of God being Co-eternal with the Father, and his Emiſſion, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the Creation of the World, if duly conſidered, as delivered by the Fathers before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, will confute all the Councils of the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> againſt thoſe parallel places of Scripture, and particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as ſpeak of the Primogeniture of our Saviour, as if he were a <hi>Deus Factus,</hi> or a Creature. Having ſhewed the Authority of Scripture and the Fathers to be againſt the <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, there is no neceſſity of urging that of Councils, which they peremptorily decline: ſo <hi>Sandius</hi> in his Preface to the Reader, <hi>Ask for the old Paths,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>not of Synods nor of Councils, nor the Books of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59637:74"/> Creeds, which later Ages have ſet forth.</hi> He was conſcious that theſe would be generally againſt him, except a few that were manged by <hi>Arian</hi> Emperors; ſo that we have their conſent to let theſe be ſilent for fear of their <hi>Anathema's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is obſerved that in all Lands, where any venemous Creatures are bred, there may be found ſome others that ſerve as an Antidote to that Venome, and ſometimes in that very Creature where the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is lodged there is a Medicine to expel it, as in the Viper; the ſame Divine Providence hath in all Ages ſo ordered it, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Hereſies have been conceived by erroneous Perſons, have been ſtifled in their birth, by ſuch as God hath raiſed up for the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them: An inſtance whereof we have in this Heretical Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, which as it was brought to light by a Rector of <hi>Exeter</hi>-Colledge, ſo by another Rector of the ſame Colledge, it was provided long before to condemn it to perpetual Darkneſs; and I may truly ſay it was <hi>Damnata prius quam nata;</hi> condemned to dye before it was born: And if the Antidote prepared by the One, be duly applied, the Doſe of Poyſon is not of ſo quick an operation, but by the Bleſſing of God, the ill effects of it may be prevented: I have therefore for the benefit of ignorant and wavering Perſons, tranſlated that Learned Lecture of the Reverend Dr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> the King's Profeſſor of Divinity in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and Rector of <hi>Exeter</hi> Colledge, in the Year 1633. which begins <hi>p.</hi> 276. of his Lectures in Folio; the Text which he choſe to inſiſt on is,

                        <hi>Matth. xvi.</hi> v. <hi>16.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>THis celebrated Teſtimony concerning our Saviour, is recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us by theſe four Particulars:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That it was not Sudden but Deliberate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It was not Private, but ſpoken in the Name of all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it was not caſually uttered, but after a double De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt. To which add,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Approbation of Chriſt, and the Reward of St. <hi>Peter</hi> that publiſhed this Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>Now the Scripture is not wont to propoſe trivial things with ſo great ſolemnity; there is therefore ſomething more in the matter than
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59637:75"/> at firſt appears in the words of this Anſwer, from whence both the Ancient and Moderns with clear and often confirmed aſſent, have believed and aſſerted not only the Humanity of Chriſt, which he took of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but alſo the Divinity of the Son of the Living God by ineffable Generation communicated to him by the Father from Eternity.</p>
               <p>But that which St. <hi>Peter</hi> foretold, That falſe Teachers ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, which will bring in damnable Hereſies, denying the Lord that bought them;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22.</note> to which they were afore ordain'd, ſaith St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> raiſed up ſaith St. <hi>Paul;</hi> fitted and prepared, that ſame, the nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeouſneſs of theſe times have vomited into the boſom of the Church, Faction doth cheriſh, Induſtry defends, Sagacity promotes, Wit urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Hypocriſie publiſheth under the Veil of Sincerity; So that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſuch as <hi>Timothy</hi> carefully take heed to themſelves and their <hi>depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi> and ſuch as St. <hi>Jude</hi> contend for the Faith once delivered, there is great danger leſt the Unclean Spirit that was caſt forth by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, return to the Houſe that is ſwept and cleanſed with a more numerous Train, and the laſt State of the Church become worſe than the former.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>S.</hi> Now among thoſe Seven unclean Spirits that create trouble to the Church ſwept and garniſhed, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Papiſts.</hi> 2. <hi>Falſe Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans.</hi> 3. <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi> 4. <hi>Diſciplinarians.</hi> 5. <hi>Weigelians.</hi> 6. <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants.</hi> 7. <hi>Socinians.</hi> The others being either ſufficiently vanquiſht or removed far from us, the <hi>Socinians</hi> in our time do more ſecretly creep in, and more dangerouſly undermine; for theſe are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent wholly to obliterate Original Sin and the Satisfaction of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, unleſs withal they wholly aboliſh the Eternity of the Son of the Living God, ſo that he may be no longer called, God man, but a Man of God, and not the Eternal Son of God, but the Son of the Eternal God; as dying <hi>Sermatus</hi> did blaſpheme</p>
               <p>It were to be wiſhed that ſuch Prodigies of Opinions had never toucht our Shoars; and it had been better that in their paſſage hither they had been ſunk in the bottom of the Sea, with a Mill-ſtone about their necks: But what muſt be done when they daily riſe up to the ſcandal of the Weak, and no ſmall diſgrace to Religion, in forreign Parts; their wicked Attempts have been oppoſed by <hi>Bellarmine, Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga, Weike</hi> and <hi>Smiglicius,</hi> Jeſuits; by <hi>Franciſco Stegmannus, Prolaeus, Meiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Martinius, Hunnius, Winkelman, Gawerus, Gerrardus, Brochmand, Himelius, Thralieus,</hi> among the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> and by <hi>Calviniſts, Luber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Lucier, Gaſmannus, Jacobus a Porta, Jo. Junius, Maccovius, Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpergerus, Wendeline, Zarnovicius</hi> and <hi>Covet,</hi> with many others; <hi>Calvin</hi> againſt <hi>Servetus Zanchius</hi> in thirteen Books, <hi>De Tribus Elohim,</hi> dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59637:75"/> to Archbiſhop <hi>Grindal,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Bedford; Zach. Urſme</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Cracovian Catechiſm; Franciſcus Junius</hi> againſt an <hi>Anonimus Arian,</hi> and others; theſe had diligently trodden down thoſe Tares for a time, which now ſpring up again with peſtilent increaſe, by the ſowing of the wicked Enemy. Our Country-men I confeſs were flower in weeding out theſe Tares; whether it was as ſurprized at the return of thoſe Blaſphemies from Hell, or whether they thought it more adviſeable to let them dye in ſilence, than curiouſly to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them to feed Curioſity. But moderate Counſels cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand importunate Attempts: their petulancy compels me to ſpeak as St. <hi>Hilary;</hi> to undertake Difficulties, and as it were to ſpeak things that ought to be kept ſecret; eſpecially ſeeing our Adverſaries tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph at our ſilence, boaſting that they have over-come, where no oppoſition is made. Now there are three things wherein we place the main hopes of our Salvation:
<list>
                     <item>I. The Knowledge of our Miſery by Original Corruption.</item>
                     <item>II. The Knowledge of a Saviour by his redeeming Satisfaction.</item>
                     <item>III. A grateful Return of faithful and due Obedience.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>But thoſe who deny Original Sin, and the Redemption of Chriſt, are not likely to be truly Grateful. Of Original Sin and the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt, I have already treated againſt theſe ſubtile Enemies, who neither acknowledge their Miſery, nor grant the Neceſſity of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Satisfaction; I now ſtand up by the aſſiſtance of Chriſt, and your leave, for the Defence of the Deity of Chriſt; eſpecially ſeeing not long ſince <hi>Jo. Crellius,</hi> by the united Strength and Arts of the whole Sect, hath ſo boldly aſſaulted the chief Foundation of our Salvation; therefore the Queſtion to be now diſcuſt is, Whether Chriſt be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God Co-eſſential with the Father and Holy Spirit?</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>S.</hi> This Queſtion that we may handle with due Reverence, and ſaving Advantage, do Thou, O Son of the Living God, Illuminate me with the Rays of thy Eternal Deity, and grant me a Mouth and Wiſdom, which they that Gainſay, may not be able to reſiſt. Being thus prepared, that I may not ſtop at the Threſhold, it muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, That the Adverſaries grant to the Father both Eternity and Perſonality, to the Son a Perſonality but not Eternity, but to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt an Eternity but not Perſonality. And in this they differ from the ancient <hi>Arians,</hi> that theſe acknowledge the Son of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God to be the firſt Born of the Creatures; but the <hi>Socinians,</hi> that he was born after his Mother: For which reaſon <hi>Smiglerius</hi> doth not well, imputing <hi>Arianiſm</hi> to them; while with more labour than ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59637:76"/> he diſputes againſt thoſe New Monſters, as he calls them; for the <hi>Socinians</hi> attribute leſs to our Saviour than the <hi>Arians;</hi> both affirm him to be a Creature, but the <hi>Arians</hi> a more noble Creature, as is manifeſt by the Diſputation held at <hi>Cracow,</hi> between <hi>Fauſtus, Socinus,</hi> and <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> a Miniſter of <hi>Tranſilvania;</hi> and therefore they affect to be called the Reformers of <hi>Arius,</hi> rather than his Diſciples, as it is in the Anſwers of <hi>Moſcorovius</hi> and <hi>Smalſius</hi> againſt <hi>Smigleſius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is to be obſerved, That the Papiſts give no ſmall advantage to the Cauſe which they oppoſe, while they tenaciouſly hold in their School-Divinity, that Chriſt merited for himſelf, and that he was our Mediator according to his Humane Nature only; for hence the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries infer, that that which he performed was but due, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was to be to his own advantage only: Whence therefore is that ſuperabundant Merit by which he ſatisfied the Father for us? And if his Humane Nature only were ſufficient for the Work of our Redemption, what need was there of his being God and Man? I know what the Jeſuits are wont to anſwer here; but in my opinion we ought not raſhly to grant any thing to ſuch Sophiſters as wreſt all things to their own ends with great Art.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This muſt not be omitted, that in Scripture he is called God, that is ſo by Nature or Donation, and by gift either in regard of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, or Miſſion, or Commiſſion, or all theſe joyntly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Obſerve that a thing is counted Eternal as to Duration, Indeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, Continuation and Signification; to Duration becauſe it wants beginning or end, and ſo God alone is Eternal, or becauſe it wants an end only, ſo Angels and Humane Souls, which are called for diſtinction ſake, Eviternal; as to Indetermination, <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was called Eternal becauſe no determinate end was appointed to it; as to Continuation, that is called Eternal that flows on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption; as to Signification, Circumciſion is called Eternal, not as to itſelf but its Anti-type.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Theſe words Eſſence, Exiſtence, Subſiſtence, ought acurately to be diſtinguiſhed one from the other; ſo that Eſſence may be fitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Nature, Subſiſtence to Perſons, Exiſtence to Notions; and for clearer diſtinction, Nature anſwers to the queſtion what, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the queſtion who, and Notion to the manner how: But we have no dependance on theſe Terms of the Fathers and Schools, but uſe them not as if our Faith needed them, but becauſe the Perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Adverſaries hath forced the Orthodox to expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after this manner, to defeat the Devices of thoſe Men who ſeek to hide themſelves in the dark Labyrinths of Humane Reaſon, whence we affirm that theſe ten words: Eſſence, Coeſſential, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59637:76"/> Subſtance, Perſon, Propriety, Relation, Notion, Circumciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Trinity, have been rightly (though unwillingly) deviſed by the Fathers, retained by the School-men, explicated by <hi>Bellarmine, Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> &amp;c. to ſerve in this buſineſs as Proſpective to diſcover the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties of the Adverſaries, which otherwiſe might eſcape their ſight, not in prejudice of the Text, but for the help of reaſoning from the Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It is agreed that there is a Trinity, and in this Trinity there is a Priority of Origination acknowledged by all: So <hi>Smalſius, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not that there is Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, and that this may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Trinity.</hi> So the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers ſay of the Son, that he is God of God, Light of Light, true God of true God, which expreſſions imply at leaſt a Prerogative of Order, though not of Nature, in which reſpect <hi>Euſebius Caeſar</hi> ſcarce deſerves to be accuſed of <hi>Arianiſm</hi> by the Papiſts, for affirming the Co-eternity of the Son with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, againſt the <hi>Arians,</hi> only he is obſerved to heſitate at their Co-equality, where if he only mean the Co-equality of Order, not of Nature, he may paſs for a good Catholick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is agreed, that Chriſt is truly and properly called the Son of the Living God, ſeeing he took his Original not after Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane manner, from mortal Seed, but was conceived in the Virgin's Womb by the Holy Spirit over-ſhaddowing her, and the Power of the moſt High coming upon her; and is therefore called the Son of God, <hi>Luke.</hi> 1.35.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is agreed, that Chriſt is expreſly called God, in reſpect of his Miſſion office and Dominion, and therefore is exalted above all Creatures, to be adored with Divine Worſhip together with the Father, and to be invoked as the Searcher of Hearts; and Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent as <hi>Smalcius</hi> confeſſeth in his Book of the Divinity of Chriſt; and <hi>Socinus</hi> in his Defence againſt <hi>Chriſtianus Franken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Queſtion then may be reduced to theſe Terms, Whether Chriſt the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the Redeemer and Saviour of us all, be God, not by Donation only from the Father, by Pre-eminence of Authority, or Dominion, but by Nature, not as to Indetermination, Continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Signification, Eviternal but Eternal without beginning or end, not of an inferior or another, but of the ſame Eſſence with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Holy Ghoſt, not of alike but the ſame Nature, as the Ancients ſpeak, and as our ſecond Article expreſſeth it, Conſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; here the <hi>Papiſts, Lutherans,</hi> the <hi>Greek, Aſian</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Church affirm as we do:</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tranſilvanians,</hi> ſome <hi>Polonians,</hi> and ſome Apoſtate <hi>Hollanders;</hi> as appears by their Writings, which are in too many hands, do deny.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:59637:77"/>
               <p>The principal Arguments for Confirmation of our part are theſe:</p>
               <p>Here we ſhall not heap up all the Arguments, but chooſe ſuch as time will permit to handle: 1. From the Text, <hi>Thou art Christ the Son of the living God,</hi> whence I argue, The Son is of the ſame Nature with the Father, ſo Man begets Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but Chriſt is the Son of God, the firſt begotten, not the firſt created, the only begotten, his proper Son, therefore he is of the ſame Eſſence with the Father, and conſequently as is expreſt in the firſt Article, of the ſame Power and Eternity. <hi>Crellius</hi> endeavours to avoid the edge of this Anſwer, by this ſorry Evaſion, That the Son of God ſignifies no more than the Anointed of God; ſo that he is called Son not by Nature but Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore the addition of, <hi>The living God,</hi> is omitted in St. <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is to find fault with the Text, rather than the Inference from it; as if St. <hi>Matthew</hi> did intend to deceive, and not inform us, and were to be corrected by St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> as <hi>Crellius</hi> would have it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis no contradiction to ſay leſs than had been ſaid by another; now in St. <hi>John</hi> we have the ſame Confeſſion as herein <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.69.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. By Unction Kings and Prieſts are made, but Sons by Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore the Word Son expreſſeth his Perſon, as the word Chriſt his Office; Chriſt and the Son of God ſignifies the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but not in the ſame reſpect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Socinus</hi> objects, That the ſame manner of expreſſion is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.10. where the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are called the Sons of the Living God, not that they were Sons co-eſſential with God, but that they were Sons of the Living God as oppoſed to Idols; whence it appears this Epithet of God, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Living, ſhews of what ſort of God Chriſt is Son, not what ſort of Son he is.</p>
               <p>To which we anſwer, That by the Adverſary's confeſſion, this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithet Living, declares what ſort of God the Father is; therefore I infer that it ſhews alſo what ſort of Son the Son is; as the Maxim is, <hi>Qualis pater talis filius, (i. e.)</hi> In living Beings, he that begets and he that is begotten is of the ſame ſort.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In <hi>Hoſea</hi> Sons of the Living God are oppoſed to ſuch as were not the People of God, not as if they were natural Sons, but adopted, by calling not by being begotten, as it is expreſs, <hi>They ſhall be called,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.26. So that here is no relation to Idols, who neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get nor are begotten.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Text ſhews the Son of the Living God is oppoſed to the Son of a Mortal Man, as being of a more excellent kind, for all ſaw him to be the Son of Man; ſome ſaid the <hi>Baptist,</hi> others that <hi>Elias</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:59637:77"/> or <hi>Jeremiah</hi> were revived. But this inſpired Confeſſion of St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſignifies ſomething more ſublime; <hi>Q. P.</hi> we profeſs that thou art not meerly the Son of mortal Man, as the <hi>Baptist</hi> and others of Humane Seed, but that thou art the Son of that Eternal God which alway liveth: As therefore he was of the ſame Nature with his Mother, as the Son of Man, ſo it is neceſſary that he be of the ſame Nature with the Father, as the Son of the Living God.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Oſtorodius</hi> objects, That begetting of a Son implys the Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Parent; for to what purpoſe are Sons begotten, but to continue the ſucceſſion of thoſe that are mortal?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is very acute! as if there were no difference between natural and temporal Generations, and this which is eternal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable: Sons are adopted to ſupply ſucceſſion; and did the Ancient of days adopt the Son of Man for ſucceſſion's ſake? See to what our Rationaliſts reduce the matter. <hi>Socinus</hi> more diſtinctly explains the Myſtery, <hi>It is not to be denied that the Power of God did convey into, or create in the Virgin's womb ſome ſubſtance, out of which, conjoyn'd with that which was of the Virgin's ſubſtance, Chriſt became true Man, who on that account had not only the Virgin for his Mother, but God alſo for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, conſidered as Man.</hi>

The Text ſpeaks of a Vertue and Power, not of any Subſtance; now a Son is product from the Subſtance of the Father, and in likeneſs of Nature, whence he is called Son of the Virgin, not of the Holy Ghoſt, who communicated a power of Conception to her: This imaginary Subſtance was either Animate or Manimate, if Animate it conſtituted an Embrio diſtinct from the Seed of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; if it was Inanimate and received a Soul by Traduction from the Virgins as our Adverſaries teach, then he was the Son of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin only, and in no way the Son of the Living God; which deſtroys this <hi>Socinian</hi> Figment.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Socinus</hi> againſt <hi>Weike,</hi> ſays he acknowledged Chriſt to be his God, not the moſt high God; but he owned him to be ſuch a God whom he ought to worſhip and believe in: Did <hi>Thomas</hi> feign to himſelf a peculiar and ſubordinate God, whom he did not believe to be the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the moſt high God? without doubt he now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that which before on the relation of the Diſciples he doubted of as incredible; but he alway believed the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be his God, therefore when he affirmeth this of Chriſt being revived, to whom he would not have given ſuch a Title, before he did attribute to Chriſt what was to be attributed to the moſt high God; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Eternity of Chriſt's Divinity is manifeſtly proved.</p>
               <p>Which 3ly, the profeſſion of our Saviour himſelf doth aſſert, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, ſaith the Lord, which is, which was, and is to come, Revel.</hi> 1.8.

               <p>
                  <hi>Engedinus</hi> and <hi>Volkelius</hi> anſwer, That theſe are not the words of Chriſt, but of that God which in the firſt Verſe is manifeſtly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from Chriſt. <hi>Ribera</hi> and <hi>A.

               <p>Thus the Ancients, <hi>Athanaſius, Nazianzen, Ruffinus, Idacius, Clarus,</hi> underſtood it; as alſo the Jeſuits <hi>Althaſar</hi> and <hi>Alapide,</hi> who forgat himſelf, or on ſecond thoughts corrected himſelf on the laſt <hi>ch. v.</hi> 13. where he adds this out of St. <hi>Ambroſe, That the ancient Chriſtians, when</hi> Arianiſm <hi>prevailed, were wont to ingrave</hi> Α <hi>and</hi> Ω <hi>on their Tombs, to ſhew their deteſtation of that Hereſie, and that they died in the Faith of him that profeſſed himſelf to be the</hi> Α <hi>and</hi> Ω; <hi>that is, the true and eternal God as the Father is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2ly, We argue from three Apoſtolical Teſtimonies; the firſt is that of St. <hi>John</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and that Word was God.</hi> What is more clear? All agree that the Word is Chriſt, who being from the beginning with God, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Father) before the Creation, it neceſſarily followeth, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59637:78"/> affirmed, that that Word was God. Which 2ly, is farther confirmed, All things were made by him, therefore the Word was not made or created, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> diſputeth. 3ly, The World in which he was, and which knew him not, was made by him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was the Creator of all things, viſible and inviſible, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. Moreover, the Word was made Fleſh when he took the Seed of <hi>Abraham; And all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily dwelt in God manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> Col. 2.9. Therefore the Word was before the Incarnation, and before the Seed which he aſſumed, and therefore more ancient than his Mother, but not as a pre-exiſtent Creature, as the <hi>Arians</hi> confeſs againſt our Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>Therefore as he was the Eternal God, it is worth our time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, with what wonderous Wreſtings the <hi>Tranſilvanians</hi> do ſtretch theſe ſo plain and evident Teſtimonies, expounded and ſet in the light by the Ancients, but obſcured by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> eſpecially by <hi>Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> in ten Homelies on this Text, the ſum of which is this: <hi>That the word Beginning doth not note the beginning of the World, but of the Goſpel; not the firſt Creation of all things, but only the Reparation and Reformation by Chriſt.</hi> As if the Evangeliſt had only ſaid, according to <hi>Smalcius</hi> his Paraphraſe, 1. <hi>In the beginning</hi> (i. e.) <hi>of publiſhing the Goſpel,</hi> 2. <hi>was the Word,</hi> (viz.) <hi>Christ;</hi> this is right. 3. <hi>And that Word was with God,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>was hid, and known only to God, or obſcurely known to ſome that were near.</hi> 4. <hi>And God was the Word, or rather by force of the Article pointing at the ſubject, the Word was God,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Man, ſo inſtructed with Divine Gifts and Vertue, that he was deſervedly worſhipped as God; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward when he appeared publickly all things were made by him, not ſimply all things, but ſuch only as concerned the Miniſtry of the Goſpel; theſe things were made, that is, reformed, re-created, and intirely reſtored: And without him was nothing made,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>without his Command, his Conduct and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and the Word was made Fleſh, (that is) ſubjected himſelf to the Miſeries and Suffering of Fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things, if I am not deceived, will appear to wiſe Men not new only, but vain and prophane; and we may juſtly cry out to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> in the words of <hi>Neimotevius</hi> to <hi>George Schomannus, I beſeech thee in the name of God, (my Brother</hi> George) <hi>that you would judge in the fear of God, how Humane Reaſon playeth the Wanton in things Divine; and how dangerous it is, to be over-wiſe, and not to be wiſe according to Sobriety.</hi> For if this be the genuine ſence of this Text, and if this beloved Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of his Lord meant nothing elſe than that his Lord in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of publiſhing the Goſpel, did lay hid for a time unknown to the World, and permitted the <hi>Baptist</hi> to forerun and prepare his way, and that he came afterward and reſtored and perfected all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59637:79"/> for the Salvation of the Church, and ſubjected himſelf to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of the Fleſh; if this be all that the laſt of the Evangeliſt and the Apocalipiſt's hath revealed from the boſom of his Lord, he might it ſeems have ſpared his labour, without any great damage to the Truth, for all theſe things were clearly and more at large treated of by the preceding three Evangeliſts: And I would willingly learn from theſe quick-ſighted Innovators, how it can agree with the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, ſimplicity, and fidelity of an Apoſtle, to promiſe a Hiſtory, and propoſe Riddles, and ſo to involve and cloath the Matters propoſed with ſuch miſtical words, as might rather ſend away the Hearer with Aſtoniſhment than Inſtruction, to invite to Secrets, when he only offers things obvious, which cannot ſatisfie expectation, and which might better expedite the thing in fewer words, as it was done by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let all wiſe Men judge, that are not partial, how well theſe <hi>Photinian</hi> Gloſſes do clear the Text, which ſays, <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.</hi> The Gloſs ſays, <hi>Not in the beginning, but before the beginning of publiſhing the Goſpel, Chriſt was hid, known only in ſecret to God.</hi> Which Fiction <hi>Martyn Cherovicius,</hi> a Confident of that Party, could not digeſt. 2ly, It follows in the Text, <hi>And that Word was God.</hi> The Gloſs ſays, <hi>He was but a made God;</hi> he might have ſaid a feign'd God. 3ly, The Text ſays, <hi>All things were made by him.</hi> The Gloſs ſays, <hi>Not all things, but the things concerning the Goſpel only, were not made but reformed by him.</hi> The Text ſays, <hi>The World was made by him.</hi> The Gloſs ſays, <hi>Not the World which we ſee, but which we expect.</hi> The Text ſays, <hi>The Word was made Fleſh.</hi> The Gloſs ſays, <hi>The Word was not made Fleſh, but only ſubjected to the Miſeries of the Fleſh.</hi> Do not theſe ſeem to you that hear them, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Gloſſes, which ſo limit the Text as to eliminate them!</p>
               <p>Let us now weigh the ſecond place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Whoſe are the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and of whom as concerning the fleſh Chriſt came, who is God over all, bleſſed for ever.</hi> The Apoſtle doth here diſtinguiſh of Chriſt, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered according to the Fleſh, and ſo he deſcended from <hi>Jewiſh</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, or as he is the Son of God, and ſo he is God over all, bleſſed for ever: What need was there of this reſtriction, <hi>(according to the Fleſh)</hi> if Chriſt were only a meer Man? They anſwer with <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> that perhaps the word God was not in the Text, being omitted by St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Hilary;</hi> but <hi>Eraſmus</hi> notes that this might be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Careleſneſs of the Tranſcribers: for <hi>Athanaſius</hi> mentions it againſt the <hi>Arians; Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Theophylact</hi> confirm it; and <hi>Pamelius</hi> teſtifies that it was in the moſt ancient Manuſcripts: the <hi>Socinians</hi> have it in their German Tranſlation, as it is reported, and <hi>Socinus</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:59637:79"/> himſelf doth not deny, but if that word were wanting, it is ſupplied by what follows, —<hi>bleſſed over all.</hi> Therefore 2ly, they flye to the point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words, and read the words thus, <hi>Of whom is Chriſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fleſh over all,</hi> here they make a Full-point, and then as a Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy they read thus, (adding the word <hi>ſit) Let God be bleſſed for ever.</hi> So that Chriſt is not here ſtiled God, but God who ſent Chriſt is praiſed; and thus indeed the German Tranſlation of the <hi>Socinians</hi> is pointed. <hi>Anſ. Matthias Glirius</hi> (as <hi>Socinus</hi> on <hi>Ariſtole</hi>'s <hi>Elenchs</hi> relates) undertook to prove from 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.22. that Jeſus was not the Chriſt, but by what Artifice, to wit, by thus wreſting the Text, <hi>Who is a lyar</hi> (ſays he) <hi>but he that denieth?</hi> here he placeth a note of Interrogation, then he proceeds, and reads thetically, <hi>becauſe Jeſus is not Christ.</hi> But <hi>Socinus</hi> explodes him as a wicked Man; let them therefore look to it who imitate him in the ſame Cauſe, how they may avoid the ſame Condemnation.</p>
               <p>The third place we urge from <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal to God; but emptied himſelf, taking the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of man.</hi> Here we have a manifeſt difference between the form of God and the form of a Servant, and theſe moſt certain Propoſitions, 1. That both theſe Forms were united in the Perſon of Chriſt. 2. That by reaſon of the firſt he was equal to God, and by reaſon of the later he was like unto Men. 3. That the firſt Form did aſſume the later by emptying himſelf; ſo that his Divinity, Equality with his Father, Incarnation, Hypoſtatical Union, and Theanthropy, which are ſeverally ſpoken of in other places, are here found joyned.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tranſilvanians,</hi> with <hi>Maximinus</hi> the <hi>Arian</hi> in St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That the words of the Apoſtle are to be read thus: <hi>Not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that rapine ſhould be made ſo as to equal himſelf with God, for ſo he ſhould be injurious to God, therefore that he might not do this, he emptied himſelf,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>he choſe rather to be a Servant than an Invador of undue Dignity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is a moſt filthy addition of the word <hi>made,</hi> the Text ſays only he thought it no Robbery to be equal; or as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſays, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riari,</hi> or be compared with God, where it is expreſſed what Chriſt did, not what he deliberated to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Socinus</hi> replies, by retorting the Argument, <hi>Chriſt is equal to God, and hath the form of God; therefore he is not that God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yea, therefore he is that God, for to whom the form agreeth the thing formed agreeth alſo; and nothing can be equal to God but God. But the word Form, he ſays, doth not here denote an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial but accidental Form only, nor can it conſiſt with God ſo to humble himſelf.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:59637:80"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Form of God here is to be taken in the ſame ſence as the Form of a Servant, becauſe there is the ſame reaſon of things op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; but this of a Servant was true and eſſential, and why not the other? So that to be in the form of God, is nothing leſs than to be the true God, who loſt nothing by humbling himſelf, but by aſſuming what he had not before, conferred many things to the Nature which he aſſumed. And all the Authority and Majeſty which was added to the Son, was not added to him as God, but as he was the Son of Man, <hi>John</hi> 5.27.</p>
               <p>Our third Argument is drawn from the Harmony of the Old and New Teſtament, in which thoſe things which in the Old Teſtament are attributed to the only true God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are in the New expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Chriſt. Out of eleven Inſtances that have been mentioned, three only ſhall ſuffice, the firſt is <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.5. <hi>The people ſpake againſt God and againſt Moſes.</hi> The Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.9. expounds this of Chriſt, <hi>Neither let us tempt Chriſt as ſome of them alſo tempted, and were deſtroyed of Serpents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Socinus</hi> objects, 1. That by <hi>Eloim</hi> in the Old Teſtament, God is not neceſſarily underſtood, but frequently an Angel, and by Chriſt in that place our Saviour is not neceſſarily underſtood but <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be ſaid that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> tempted Chriſt in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not in his own Perſon which then was not, but in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Type.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But <hi>Eloim</hi> which is here put abſolutely in the ſix and ſeven Verſes following, is expreſly called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which agrees not with Angels. And let <hi>Socinus</hi> ſhew where ever <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called Chriſt, or where the name of Chriſt put abſolutely, is attributed in the New Teſtament to any other than to our Saviour.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. To tempt any one before he was is ſaid <hi>gratis,</hi> but thus they fall into temptation who attempt to deprive the Son of the Living God of his Deity and Eternity.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Inſtance is out of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> where that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the glorious going of <hi>Jehovah, Pſal.</hi> 68.19. is expounded of Chriſt aſcending on high, and leading Captivity Captive, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly, That which is aſcribed to <hi>Jehovah, Worſhip him all ye Angels, Pſal.</hi> 97.7. is affirmed of Chriſt <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3ly, That which is affirmed of the Creator of Heaven and Earth, <hi>Thou Lord in the beginning haſt laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the Works of thy hands,</hi> Pſal. 102.26. is attributed to Chriſt in the ſelf ſame words, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.10.</p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:59637:80"/>
               <p>The Adverſaries are diligent to decline this either by denying that theſe things in the Old Teſtament are to be underſtood of the moſt high God, or to be repeated in the New Teſtament concerning Chriſt, or by affirming that theſe things may be accommodated to Chriſt, but not as God of the ſame Nature with the Father, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did repreſent the Perſon of the moſt high God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not only the words but the ſcope of thoſe Texts do exclude theſe Evaſions: That if in any manner our Saviour repreſented the Perſon of his Father in the Old Teſtament, it was then neceſſarily before he was born of the Virgin; which wholly deſtroys the Cauſe of our Adverſaries.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly, The ſame is proved out of the Prophets, for that Majeſty of the moſt High, which is ſo magnificently deſcribed <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.1. is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto Chriſt by Name, <hi>Theſe things ſpake Eſay, when he ſaw his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſpake of him,</hi> John 12.41. Many others of this ſort may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Socinus</hi> objects, That theſe things are either ſpoken figuratively, or are adapted to Chriſt only by way of accommodation, but conclude nothing of his Eternal Deity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Then thoſe Apoſtles and Evangeliſts which urge and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate them to that purpoſe, do deal with us ſophiſtically, or unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and are to be corrected and explained by Poſterity, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Socinians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth Argument is drawn from certain Attributes aſcribed to Chriſt, which clearly evince that he is of the ſame Nature and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency with the Father; of very many I ſhall only name three, <hi>viz.</hi> Eternity in reſpect of Time, Omnipreſence in reſpect of Place, and Adoration in reſpect of Sovereign Majeſty and Dominion: Now his Eternity is aſſerted from theſe places; <hi>The Lord hath poſſeſt me in the beginning of his ways, from the beginning before he made any thing,</hi> Prov. 8.22. The <hi>Syriack</hi> read <hi>from Eternity;</hi> the <hi>Arabick, I have begot thee before the Morning-ſtar,</hi> Pſ. 110. 2ly, <hi>His coming forth is from the days of eternity;</hi> To which, 3ly, our Saviour confirms the ſame of himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.58. <hi>Before Abraham was, I am.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here <hi>Socinus</hi> objects, That in the firſt place Wiſdom ſignifies not the Son of God, but the Wiſdom of God; nor doth this expreſſion of <hi>the beginning of his ways,</hi> ſignifie Eternity but Antiquity.</p>
               <p>But this Interpretation is excluded by the following Verſe, <hi>I was ſet up from everlaſting, from the beginning before the earth was.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle confirms our Argument, <hi>We preach Chriſt the power of God, and the wiſdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.4.</p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:59637:81"/>
               <p>To our ſecond Argument, he cavils, That thence it would follow that Chriſt from Everlaſting came forth from <hi>Bethleam.</hi> This is a ſhift, for the Text of the Prophet ſuggeſts a double going forth; a temporal concerning which 'tis ſaid in the Future Tenſe, <hi>He will go forth,</hi> the fulfilling of which Prediction the Evangeliſts obſerves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.6. And an eternal, of which it is ſaid in the Preterperfect Tenſe, <hi>His going forth was from eternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the third he trifles, that the <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be, but to become; and hence the Vulgar reads, <hi>Before he became, Abraham,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>a Father of Nations, I am,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>I was ſent to pluck down the partition wall, to bring the Gentiles into the Church.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Queſtion was not concerning the calling of the Gentiles, but whether Chriſt preceded <hi>Abraham</hi> ſo as he might ſee him; our Saviour affirms that he was, <hi>(viz.)</hi> by the glory which he had with the Father before the World began, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.5. which the <hi>Jews</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to refute with Stones, as now the <hi>Socinians</hi> by Subterfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>Again, we aſſert his Omniprefence from <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.13. <hi>None hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into heaven but he that came down from heaven, the Son of Man which is in heaven, where he was before,</hi> John 6.62. Now this he ſpake to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> while he was on Earth, and yet he declared that he was then in Heaven; therefore at the ſame time he was in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and on Earth.</p>
               <p>The Innovators do here betake themſelves to an unheard of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That as <hi>Moſes</hi> was taken up into the Mount, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> into the third Heavens, that they might be inſtructed of God, ſpeaking to them as it were face to face; ſo it was more convenient that the Son ſhould be aſſumed into Heaven and inſtructed by the Father. Which they think was done during thoſe forty Days which intervened between his Baptiſm and his Conflict with Satan: this though they do not urge as an Article of Faith, yet <hi>Smalcius</hi> ſaith, <hi>We are fully perſwaded of it, and greatly rejoyce that this Miſtery is revealed to us by God in the Scripture.</hi> But this Miſtery, nor the Revelation of it doth pleaſe us, for what need was there that he ſhould be taken up into Heaven for a more perfect Information, on whom the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit did deſcend, and in whom the Godhead dwelt Bodily, in whom the Father was always, and he in the Father. 2ly, He was amongſt the wild Beaſts in the Wilderneſs for the ſpace of thoſe forty Days, the Devil tempting him, and the Angels miniſtering unto him, as St. <hi>Mark</hi> expreſly ſaith: Was the Deſart Heaven, and were Satan and the Beaſts admitted into it? Nor doth this Fiction ſatisfie the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeeing we thus urge the Text, That the Son of Man whom
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59637:81"/> 
                  <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſaw and ſpake to, ſaith expreſly of himſelf, that he was then in Heaven; which could not be as he was a Man, therefore it muſt be as he was God Omnipreſent. The more the Adverſaries do ſtrive in this Point, the more they intangle themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We infer the Deity of Chriſt from the Adoration which was performed unto him, for he was adored as God by <hi>Stephen</hi> the Proto-Martyr, calling on him, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.59. <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Francis David</hi> anſwereth, That that Jeſus here is of the Genitive Caſe, and the ſence is this, <hi>O thou Lord who art the Father of Jeſus;</hi> making the Father to be the Object of Invocation, not the Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtianus Franken</hi> preſſeth the ſame Argument in his Diſputation againſt <hi>Socinus,</hi> concerning the Adoration of Chriſt, where be adds, that Jeſus ſignifieth a Saviour; but who can ſo ſave us as the Father. <hi>Socinus</hi> replys, That the name Jeſus here is the proper name of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not an Appellative of his Office, for then it ſhould be read, <hi>O Lord of Jeſus;</hi> which though they do confute the trifling of <hi>Franken</hi> in the Interpretation of this place, yet they do not anſwer it, by ſhewing how Adoration may be given to Chriſt whom they account to be a Creature; ſeeing that of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.8. ſaith expreſly, <hi>I am Jehovah, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another.</hi> This Knot <hi>Socinus</hi> could not untie with all his skill.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly, We might urge the Works of Chriſt: 1. The Creation, for <hi>by him all things were made,</hi> Col. 1.16. 2. Conſervation, <hi>He ſuſtains all things by the word of his power,</hi> Heb. 1.3. 3. He wrought Miracles in his Name and Authority. 4. He forgave Sins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.5. He ſent the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. Which things do exalt him above the rank of Creatures; but becauſe the Adverſaries do refer all theſe things to a delegated and derived Power, and not to an innate Power, which we have already proved, this may ſuffice.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place we ſhall ſhew ſome Abſurdities which will follow on this Heterodoxy of our Adverſaries; for if Chriſt being of the ſame Nature with the Father, were not the Supreme God, it would follow, that the Scriptures do exhibit to us great Uncertainties in the great buſineſs of Salvation. 2ly, That the Churches, the Councils, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of all ſorts, of all Ages, in all places, have recommended to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity Heretical Creeds, and monſtrous Comments. 3ly, That the Martyrs have ſealed ridiculous things with their Bloud. 4ly, That we have given up our names in Baptiſm to a Creature as well as to a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and Worſhip and Invocate a Creature with the ſame Religious Worſhip: And ſeeing it is acknowledged that Chriſt ſent the Holy Ghoſt, which received from Chriſt what he delivered, <hi>John</hi> 16.14. It would follow, 5ly, That a Creature did contribute ſomething to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59637:82"/> the Eternal Power, and made uſe of his Service. 6ly, From hence it may be concluded that our Mediator was inſufficient for ſo great an Office, ſeeing all that he did perform was due Debt, every Creature being ſo ſubject to the Creator that it can merit nothing from him. Whence it followeth, <hi>laſtly,</hi> That the publication of the Law was in vain, and the puniſhment threatned to Offenders fruſtrate, becauſe it was impoſſible that a Finite Creature could ſatisfie Infinite Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Therefore if our Saviour be not only the Son of Man, but alſo the Eternal Son of the Living God; that Lord God the Α and Ω, which is, which was, and is to come, the Almighty; if he were in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with God; if he is God over all, bleſſed for ever; if he thought it no Robbery to be equal with God, and the eſſential Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of <hi>Jehova</hi> are every-where attributed to him; if he did by his own Power do ſuch Works as no Creature could do, then thoſe Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies which follow on the Opinions of the Adverſaries are intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and we may truly and confidently conclude, Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour to be of the ſame Eſſence and Power with the Father and Holy Spirit, which was to be demonſtrated.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>An Anſwer to the Objections of the Adverſaries.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jo. Crellius</hi> in his two Books of <hi>One God the Father,</hi> urgeth ſixty two Objections, which we will reduce to ſeven Heads, under which the reſt will be eaſily conſidered and confuted: <hi>First,</hi> He argues from excluſive Particles, that the Father only is the Supreme God: So <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is life eternal to know thee only the true God. There is one God the Father of all, who is above all,</hi> Eph. 4.6. <hi>To us there is one God the Father of whom are all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.6. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.27. <hi>To God only wiſe, be glory.</hi> Hence he concludes that Chriſt is not the Supreme God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Anſwer in general: Theſe Particles do exclude only the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Idols, not the Perſons of the Son or Holy Ghoſt; and the Particle <hi>only</hi> in S. <hi>John,</hi> doth not limit the word thee but God, and it may be referred to the word know, as if it had been ſaid, This is ſufficient to eternal Life if they only know him that did ſend and him that was ſent; or as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> reads, <hi>This is life eternal to know thee and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent, to be the only true God;</hi> otherwiſe nothing is to be known concerning Chriſt, but that he is ſent. To that in the <hi>Corinth.</hi> as it is attributed to the Father that he is the One God, ſo Chriſt is called the One Lord; now if becauſe the Father is called the One God, the Son be excluded from the Deity, by the ſame reaſon, becauſe the Son is called the One Lord, the Father may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from being our Lord. The ſame Anſwer ſerves to that in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59637:82"/> 
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. and <hi>Jude</hi> 4. as to that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. it expreſly includes Chriſt the Wiſdom of God, as the name God alſo includes the Trinity, where there is not a diſtinct mention of Perſons.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly, They urge our Saviours own Confeſſion, <hi>Of that day and hour knoweth none, neither the Angels in heaven, nor the Son,</hi> and as St. <hi>Mark</hi> adds, <hi>But the Father only:</hi> Therefore the Son is not Omniſcient, and by conſequence he is not the Supreme God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No one knows, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> no Creature; for ſo Chriſt appeared and was accounted by them that queſtioned with him: But this doth not exclude Chriſt as God, nor the Holy Spirit which ſearcheth the deep things of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. Thus when it is read, <hi>No man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who the Father is but the Son;</hi> will you therefore conclude that the Father knoweth not himſelf, or that the Holy Ghoſt knows him not? Or when you read, that <hi>none knows the things of God, but the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.11. therefore the Son and the Father do not know the things of God. Men of reaſon ſhould be aſhamed of ſuch an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. The word <hi>alone</hi> therefore doth not exclude all ſimply, but ſuch in a certain ſort whom it concerned not to know, and therefore ought to watch leſt that day ſhould come on them ſleeping and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared. 2ly, Others add that the word <hi>(knoweth)</hi> doth not denote ſimply to know a thing, but as in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Conjugation <hi>Hephil,</hi> to make others know; which they confirm from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I determined not to know any thing among you but Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified; (i. e.)</hi> it is my Office not to teach any other thing. But I think this not ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable, for then neither the Father nor the Holy Spirit did ſo know as to teach or make others to know it: But Chriſt as the Son of Man did not know it ſimply, but as the Son of God, the ſame God with the Father and the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly, They urge two Viſions, the firſt from <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13, 14. Where one like the Son of Man came to the Ancient of Days, and received from him Glory, and Power, and a Kingdom. The ſecond from <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.7. Where the Lamb whom all confeſs to be Chriſt, received a Book from him that ſate on the Throne: Where the Giver and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver are really diſtinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If the Son of Man in the firſt Viſion doth denote Chriſt, as we acknowledge, then he did exiſt before he was born of the Virgin; which confutes the Adverſaries. In the ſecond the Lamb had the ſame Honour given him from the twenty four Elders, and from all the Creatures, as he that ſate on the Throne; which argueth an E<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quality of Excellency; ſo that all theſe imply a diſtinction of Perſons, not a diverſity of Nature.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:59637:83"/>4ly, They urge thoſe places wherein Chriſt is ſaid to receive all things from the Father, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. <hi>All power is given to me in heaven and earth,</hi> Joh. 5.26. The Father hath given to the Son to have Life in himſelf, whence he is ſaid to be the Image, Brightneſs and Character only of his Father's Perſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. Now it is (ſay they) neceſſary that he who receiveth, be inferior to him that giveth, and the Image or Character to its Proto-type.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ. John</hi> 5.2. reſolves all theſe Objections: That God gave him authority of exerciſing Judgment as he is the Son of Man, not of God, for ſo he is God of God, Light of Light, the eſſential Image and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Perſon of his Father, and inferior only in Order, not in Nature or Time. But theſe Men will not diſtinguiſh with St. <hi>John,</hi> between Chriſt's Humane and his Divine Nature: nor with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> between the Form of God and the Form of a Servant; but this is their conſtant practice to confound the Eſſence and the Perſon.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly, They object, that Chriſt is numbred among the Creatures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called the firſt born of every Creature, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Creation, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.14. He that ſhall deliver up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to God the Father, and be ſubject to him; therefore he cannot be of the ſame Nature and Excellency.</p>
               <p>To this it is anſwered before, That he is called the firſt begotten, not the firſt created, for he was begotten from Eternity, before all Creatures, which were made by him, as it there followeth; he was not created in Time as the Creatures were: And if he had been ſo the firſt born, he had been before the Angels and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which the <hi>Socinians</hi> do deny againſt the <hi>Arians.</hi> 2. The Apocalipt calls him the beginning of the Creatures of God, as the Active Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple from whom all the Creatures had their beginning, not the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, as if he were the firſt of thoſe things that were created. 3. The delivering of the Kingdom into the hands of the Father, and his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection thereupon, is not the ſubjection of the Nature, but of the Eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, (after the finiſhing of the Mediatorial Office) or (if I may ſo ſpeak) the reſignation or laying down of that Office, that he might reſume that Glory forever, which he affirms he had with his Father before the World was, <hi>John</hi> 17.5.</p>
               <p n="6">6ly, They oppoſe this External Generation and Glory of the Son, by reaſons, for upon ſuppoſition of ſuch Generation, <hi>Crellius</hi> ſaith it would follow, 1. That the Son would be the Son of himſelf. 2. There would be infinite Sons. 3. That the Son would be from Eternity and not from Eternity. 4. That the Son was yet to be generated and to be generated to Eternity; which are things irrational, and not to be admitted.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:59637:83"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Reaſon doth not comprehend things Infinite, though Faith may apprehend them; therefore it is unreaſonable to meaſure by the Rule of Reaſon thoſe things which are peculiar to Faith only, and depend on Revelation only; and it is ſufficiently revealed to us in the Scripture, that there is One God, and that in this Unity there are three Perſons, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt: This we believe becauſe it is written, and do not doubt, though it appear not by Humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning how this can be; however, we deny that from the Arguings of the Adverſaries, or from Reaſon rightly informed, it would follow, Firſt, That according to our Opinion the Son ſhould be the Son of himſelf, becauſe one Eſſence doth not beget another, but one Perſon begets another as the Father the Son, who of him becomes another Perſon, not another thing. 2. It is but his Dream of infinite Sons, ſeeing that the only begotten is of infinite Perfection, which is not diviſible or multiplicable. 3. Nor is Eternity repugnant to Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for <hi>Moſcorovius</hi> againſt <hi>Smigletius,</hi> defends the probability of it, the <hi>Materia Prima</hi> to be eternal and uncreate and ſo ſtill to remain; which yet the Leaders of this Opinion will not grant to be, and not to be from Eternity; thus ſuppoſing the Sun to be eternal, its ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor (which all would grant to have been to be, and to endure with it) muſt be eternal. 4. Therefore when the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs this eternal Generation of the Son, by the Emanation of Light from Light, they do not mean that which is fleeting from that which is fixed, but do manifeſt as much as they could the Equality and Co-eternity of Perſons in their Order, affirming the Son to be begotten <hi>Genitum non generandum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> They load the Incarnation with ſo many Abſurdities, as if from thence it would follow, 1. That the Father and Holy Spirit were as much incarnate as the Son. 2. That the Perſon of the Son did wholly ceaſe. 3. That things in themſelves different did unite. Or, 4. or at leaſt that as <hi>Neſtorius</hi> ſays, two Perſons did yet ſubſiſt in the Son. But this Heap of Trifles hath been long ſince confuted by thoſe of our Party.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hierome Zanchy,</hi> whoſe words are worthy to be repeated, treating of this Controverſy, ſaith, <hi>I affirm that I never read any thing in the Writings of</hi> Lelius Socinus, Ochinus, Servetus, <hi>and the reſt of that Bran, whoſe Dirt is flung about by the Modern</hi> Socinians, <hi>that hath any thing of that Accuracy which many Books of the Ancient Hereticks had, for they are all either the old Song repeated an hundred times, or new Impertinencies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned before they were conceived.</hi> Thus that Strenuous Doctor, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Primitive Diſcipline, and of great Learning and Experience in theſe Controverſies. To whom we may add the Acurate <hi>Biſterfield.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:59637:84"/>
               <p>The Sum of all is this: We do not ſay, that the Eſſence was Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, but the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity. 2ly, That he did not by this ceaſe to be a Perſon, becauſe he aſſumed the Humane Nature, not a Perſon. 3ly, Not that by this Aſſumption the Divine Nature were any way perfected, but that he thereby perfected the Humane. Whence 4ly, different Natures, as the Soul and Body in Man, did u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in one Perſon by an ineffable but poſſible Union; not making two Perſons, as <hi>Neſtorius</hi> dreamed, becauſe they have but one Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, which the Humane Nature that was aſſumed brought not with itſelf, but the Divine Nature aſſuming, did confer. And thus you have (as time gave leave) in one View, the chief Points of this large and intricate Controverſie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To God the Father, to the Son God and Man, and to the Holy Ghost, be all Honour, Praiſe, and Glory, now and for ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <head>ANIMADVERSIONS ON <hi>The Naked Goſpel.</hi> As now Publiſhed By <hi>ARTH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RY,</hi> D. D.</head>
            <p>THat this Book is now firſt publiſhed by the Doctor whoſe Name is prefixed, cannot in Juſtice be denied by them that have read the former; for it is quite another Book, and it may be true, though either one or the other, if not both of the former Editions of the <hi>Naked Goſpel</hi> were publiſhed by the ſame Author, becauſe they are not the ſame Books, yet the one which he having cauſed to be printed and diſperſed among his Friends in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the Nation, and the other wherein he made ſeveral Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, may be affirmed to be publiſhed by the ſame hand, the truth whereof needs no farther enquiry, after the <hi>Oxford</hi> Animadverſions: That this preſent Copy is another Book, appears by its divers Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Additions which are made; whether for the better or the worſe, will appear to every judicious Reader; and that there needs no other, or ſeverer Reflections on it, than what the Author himſelf hath made: He ſeems ſo to tumble in the Net which he hath woven, as to be more intangled by ſtriving to get out. In his Preface to the Reader he confeſſeth, <hi>He had not patience to be ſilent at ſuch a time, when the ſuppreſſion of ſuch Opinions as he hath publiſhed, would have been greatly advantagious both to Truth and Peace.</hi> And whether it would not have been a great degree of ſaucineſs by a point blanck Addreſs of ſuch a Preſent as the <hi>Naked Goſpel,</hi> to direct the Venerable Body of the Convocation of the Clergy in what they had to do, is put beyond doubt by the <hi>Oxford</hi> Convocation: I cannot find, as he ſays, that it
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59637:85"/> was intended that the Convocation of the Clergy was called to make Alterations in Matters of Faith, nor that we are to weigh at the ſame Beam a Rite in the one, and a Doctrine in the other Seale. The Convocation I believe would have given up all their Rites and Ceremonies, rather than the Doctrines of the Trinity and Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the Doctor on pretence of Charity, would have them to abandon.</p>
            <p>He confeſſeth, <hi>That his Book was penned with leſs caution than was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for what was to be expoſed to every vulgar eye.</hi> But how could he imagine, that ſo many learned and good Men would be pleaſed with his queſtioning or denying the truth and belief of ſuch Doctrines as they themſelves believe to be neceſſary to Salvation. He might therefore very well have ſpared his unbecoming Reflections on that Body.</p>
            <p>That the Doctor was ſuſpected to disbelieve the Doctrine of the Trinity and Incarnation, was not becauſe he did not expreſly declare his Opinion concerning them, which a true Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and one that had been long before ſuſpected as Heterodox, writing on that ſubject, was highly concern'd to do; but becauſe he hath ſlily and frequently inſinuated divers Arguments againſt them; and his daubing with untempered Mortar in his two new Chapters of the Trinity and Incarnation, will render the matter more obſcure and defaced.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe words in the concluſion, which he conceives ſome are moſt offended with, wherein he cannot ſubmit to the leaſt compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: Let him enjoy his own Sentiments; only I cannot perſwade my ſelf, that more than his, an hundred years experience, calls on us to tack about, and ſteer a contrary courſe to what our Pilots in the greateſt part of that time have ſteered.</p>
            <p>As the number of thoſe Men who are as ſick of King <hi>William,</hi> as they were lately of King <hi>James,</hi> is ſo ſmall, that they may be all writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a Ring: If he intends (as the current of his Diſcourſe would carry it) ſuch as were in the late Convocation, all which had teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by ſolemn Oaths, and divers of them by their learned Arguments and Exhortations, their cheerful Obedience to their preſent Majeſties (whom God preſerve as the moſt hopeful Defenders of our eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion); ſo I heartily pray there may not be one ſuch Prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor left among us, though even among the Twelve Diſciples of our Saviour, there was a <hi>Judas;</hi> and I hope there is not one of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand among our Clergy that is ſo ill as the Doctor would repreſent them; ſuch I mean, as (he ſays) <hi>would wiſh for the cruel</hi> French, <hi>to deliver them from the preſent Government, or that is ſo unreaſonably jealous,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59637:85"/> as to think that his preſent Majeſty deſigns to make this Church, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to that in which himſelf was educated:</hi> for which his vile ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, contrary to His Majeſties moſt gracious Aſſurances, the Doctor is concern'd to beg His Majeſty's Pardon; and I pray God to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him alſo: It is a moſt invidious and malicious Quere which he adds, —<hi>Which of the two are the truer Church of</hi> England-men, <hi>thoſe who dread the return of King</hi> James, <hi>with his Jeſuits; or thoſe who wiſh and labour for it? Thoſe who are ſo ſtiff as rather to hazard the whole, than to part with the leaſt circumſtance? —And cover their ſtiffneſs to their own humours and intereſts with the ſpecious pretence of zeal for the Church?</hi> To which I anſwer, That as I do not know, ſo if I did know any perſon ſo ill affected, I ſhould abhor them as the Peſts of the Nation.</p>
            <p>To thoſe of the Doctor I ſhall oppoſe theſe Queries, Which are the truer Church of <hi>England men,</hi> thoſe who dread the growth and ſucceſs of the <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Hereſies; or thoſe who adhere to the eſtabliſhed Doctrine of the Trinity and Incarnation of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour? Thoſe who would erect a <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Turkiſh Faith,</hi> on the Ruines of that which is truly Chriſtian, Ancient and Catholick? or thoſe who live in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> where this Chriſtian Religion is eſtabliſhed? Every good Proteſtant will readily anſwer theſe Queries. And notwithſtanding the Proteſtation of the Doctor in the cloſe of his Epiſtle to the Reader, <hi>That he is not conſcious of having contradicted any of the Church's Articles in any one word:</hi> The impartial Reader will perceive by what hath been diſcovered, to be the deſign of the <hi>Naked Goſpel</hi> in the foregoing Exercitations, that it was mainly intended againſt the moſt important of thoſe Articles. I only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to the Doctor's ſerious Conſideration, that as it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Phrenſie for any that abhors Popery and Slavery, to grow weary of the preſent Government, and to deſire the return of the late King by a <hi>French</hi> Power, ſo it is the higheſt degree of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, for a Perſon that hath been long educated and inſtructed in the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which teacheth to adore the bleſſed Jeſus, as King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, not only to dethrone, but debaſe him as a meer Creature, and eſteem no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe of him, than as a King <hi>de Facto,</hi> made and advanced by Imperial and Papal Edicts and Decrees, not ſo ancient as <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> but by <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Damaſus</hi> biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> See <hi>p.</hi> 38. of the Edition in two Colums.</p>
            <p>From what Point the Wind blew that hath cauſed the Doctor to ſteer a courſe contrary to what he intended at his firſt ſetting out, is
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59637:86"/> not ſo intelligible, as to gueſs at what Harbor he intends to lay up; he doth ſeemingly at leaſt recant many of thoſe Heretical Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he had aſſerted in the firſt Edition of the <hi>Naked Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> but ſo inconſiſtently, that the New Piece which he hath patcht on upon the Old Garment, will make the Rent worſe. But this is no other artifice than what hath been practiſed by the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> heretofore, whoſe feigned Confeſſions and Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations they on occaſion recanted again, and their later Deeds have been worſe than the former.</p>

               </gap> or Perſon, which he would tranſlate being<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and propriety. The word Subſtance he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 45. is ſo much applied to matter, that ſome with great confidence deride it as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to ſay, that a Subſtance can be immaterial: of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion were <hi>Vorſtius</hi> and <hi>Hobs;</hi> and how much the Doctor differs from them, that which follows may evidence. The more we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to our own Senſes, (ſays the Doctor) or <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the more ſtrongly are our Minds poſſeſt, that Subſtance muſt be material, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the word Perſon, <hi>p.</hi> 46. he ſays, <hi>Could we be as ſenſible that the word Perſon in its metaphyſical height is no leſs improperly applied to the ſecond Diſtinction in the Trinity, than the word Begotten is in its Phyſical baſeneſs, and could we caſt away that improper word, and uſe the warier word Subſiſtence and Propriety, we ſhould more eaſily ſatisfie our ſelves, and others:</hi> Wherefore taking the word Subſtance for Subſiſtence, and Perſon for Propriety, he proceeds to give us a new Notion of the Trinity, ſuch as agrees with the Doctrine of <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus,</hi> and <hi>Sabellius, That the one high God is both Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</hi> His Poſitions are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That God is a Being abſolutely perfect.</hi> 2. <hi>That Mind is the moſt perfect Being.</hi> The ſame with <hi>Plato</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>As Mind is the moſt perfect Being, ſo the moſt perfect Being muſt be a perfect Mind, but an unthinking Mind cannot be a perfect one; God therefore was never unthinking; and ſince thought is the firſt and proper Iſſue of a thinking Mind, therefore may it moſt properly be ſtiled, <hi>The firſt begotten Son and co-eternal with the Father;</hi> becauſe the Father was never before him, <hi>p.</hi> 48. <hi>A thought is no leſs than a word conceived, and a word is no more than a thought brought forth. The Mind, or its Wiſdom cannot be abſolutely perfect, if they do not, or cannot perform, or want Power to act, there muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59637:86"/> be a third Perſon which the Scripture calls the Holy Ghost, which is conſtantly deſcribed by Power and Action.</hi> This is the Doctor's <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by which he thinks he hath obliged all Mankind, diſplayed the Myſtery of the Trinity, which hath been the trouble of all Ages, and in which he hath not advanced one Propoſition without warrant from the Scripture, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Fathers of the Church, and the beſt Champions for that Doctrine; and (that which is his greateſt hope, is) that the <hi>Unitarians</hi> will not diſſent from one of them, if taken in that ſence which their terms freely offer, <hi>p.</hi> 51. And I fear it is to ſerve their Hypotheſis, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor hath conceived and publiſhed this Notion.</p>
            <p>It is not a little ſurpriſing, that the Doctrine which was ſo lately <hi rend="margSglQuotes">ridicul'd, under the term Myſtery, and which muſt remain ſo ſtill, a point of Puſh-pin Divinity. The <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Doctrine fit to be numbred with the <hi>Roman,</hi> and would be fairly dealt with if left on the ſame level with the <hi>Arian,</hi> equally unworthy not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of our Faith, but our Study, (ſee <hi>The Naked Goſpel,</hi> print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in two Columns, <hi>p.</hi> 38.) A long and miſchievous Controverſie; and, Behold now the ground on which one of our Fundamental Articles is built; ſhould <hi>now</hi> deſerve another <hi>Ecce</hi> to behold (<hi>p.</hi> 49. of the Doctor's Edition) how the very Light of Nature demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates St. <hi>John</hi>'s Myſtery, <hi>There are three that bear witneſs in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 53. How our Platonizing Doctor confutes the Atheiſts who accuſe this Myſtery as contrary to Reaſon, which he now ſaith reaſon in <hi>Plato</hi> diſcovereth; the Doctor having adapted a Natural Trinity for his Natural Religion.</p>
            <p>But the Doctor is conſcious of another Error, <hi>viz.</hi> That he hath Sabellionized with <hi>Sabellius,</hi> for mentioning St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion concerning the Trinity, <hi>p.</hi> 50. ſays, that <hi>it favors more of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellianiſm than his, as above explained.</hi> As the Doctor's Opinion is by him explained, it may ſerve as the Center wherein all the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Ancient and Modern Hereticks may meet and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce; <hi>Vm. Lirinenſis</hi> asks, <hi>Quis ante ſceleratum Sabellium Unitatis Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatem conſundere Auſus est?</hi> Whoever ſo confounded the <hi>Doctrine of the Trinity</hi> as the impious <hi>Sabellius?</hi> Of whom <hi>Sandius</hi> ſays, <hi>Sabelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani tribuendo patri eſſentiam filio ſcientiam ſancto vitam videntur negaſſe ſubſiſtentiam filii &amp; ſancti, Sandius</hi> p. 120.

Sabelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us <hi>taught the one God in Eſſence and Subſtance to be the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, which three he called three Vertues (or Proprieties) three Names, three Perſons; and for proof of this Opinion produced theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures:

               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; Whence his Followers, as <hi>Sandius</hi> obſerves, were called <hi>Patropaſſians,</hi> as teaching God the Father by the aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of Humane Nature to be called the Son, and in that Nature the Father ſuffered, becauſe one and the ſame God was Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, without diſtinction of Perſons; which, as <hi>Lirinenſis</hi> ſaid, was to confound the Trinity; and (as our Doctor doth) make it to conſiſt of one Subſtance and two Proprieties or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergies, <hi>viz.</hi> to Think and to Act.</p>
            <p>The Doctor ſays, that Thought is the firſt begotten Son of God, that Thought is a Word brought forth, and is the ſame in ſubſtance with the Mind whence it iſſueth; but if it iſſueth from the Mind, it becomes ſeparate, and cannot be any longer the ſame with the Mind. And this Opinion is the ſame which <hi>Philaſtrius</hi> notes to be the Opinion of <hi>Paulus</hi> of <hi>Samoſata,</hi> That the Word was not the ſubſtantial Son of God, co-eternal with the Father, but the <hi>Verbum</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the enunciative or prolative Word, only an aery Sound, not a living and ſempeternal Perſon, co-equal with the Father. An Opinion ſomewhat like that of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> concerning the Trinity, which he makes God the Father ſpeaking by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and by Chriſt in the New.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sandius</hi> obſerves the like of <hi>Coſmas,</hi> who taught with <hi>Sabellius,</hi> That the Word of God was naked and without any ſubſiſtence; which his Followers called <hi>Verbum vocale &amp; enunciativum,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time internal or mental, <hi>p.</hi> 117. And he tells us, that though the Modern <hi>Socinians</hi> deteſt the Error of <hi>Sabellius,</hi> yet they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly guilty of it, <hi>p.</hi> 120. Near of kin are the Doctor's new No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſecond Perſon in the Holy Trinity, to the old Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ſo often condemned, making the ſecond Perſon a Thought, the third a Power; and he might have named as many more of the Divine Propriety, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Holineſs, Love, Juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as would have made a Denary of Perſons.</p>
            <p>The Doctor deſcribes the third Perſon in the Trinity by Power and Action, and this deſcription he ſays is conſtantly uſed in the Holy Scripture. Though we find the Attribute of <hi>Holy</hi> more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59637:87"/> annexed to that of the Spirit, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit,</hi> Eph. 1.13. and the Holy Ghoſt in almoſt an hundred places.</p>
            <p>We find alſo that of Power attributed to the ſecond Perſon more eminently than to the third, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. Chriſt is called <hi>the power of God, and the wiſdom of God.</hi> Matth. 28.18. <hi>All power is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to me in heaven and earth.</hi> Hebr. 1.3. <hi>He upholds all things by the word of his power.</hi> Matth. 9.6. <hi>The Son of Man hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on earth to forgive ſins.</hi> And he that made and upholds, and ſhall judge all Men, may moſt properly be called the power of God. How vain then is that boaſt of the Doctor's, <hi>p.</hi> 49. <hi>That this his way of tracing the Holy Trinity, agrees to a ſyllable with the words of the Holy Scripture, and the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and is more plain to be underſtood and proved, than that magiſterial way vulgarly uſed, wherein Reaſon is not permitted to ſpeak,</hi> p. 50. This is <hi>Platonis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum Majore faſtu;</hi> to oppoſe his private Reaſon againſt both the Reaſon and Authority of that Church whereof he profeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Son, and impoſe on it an old Hereſie in a new Dreſs. <hi>Bellar. in Cronol.</hi> ſays, That <hi>Fr.

            <p>And he endeavours to prove it impertinent to our Lord's deſign, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That we ſhould enquire after the Dignity of his Perſon, that he was the Eternal Son of God; this he calls Boys play, and Puſh-pin, and quotes the Judgment of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> for it: <hi>When the Game</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>was first ſet on foot.</hi> Then <hi>p.</hi> 29. of the firſt Edition, <hi>It was no more neceſſary to underſtand the Dignity of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (of Chriſt) than for a Traveller to underſtand the Features of the Sun.</hi> Now <hi>p.</hi> 55. of the new Edition, <hi>If we regard the Dignity of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is plainly more honourable to believe him God the Creator, than a Creature Deified.</hi> Then <hi>p.</hi> 30. (he ſays,) <hi>That part of Mankind which our Lord moſt favoureth, are moſt unable to pay him ſuch a belief.</hi> Now p. 54. <hi>If we conſider the thing it ſelf, it appears much more credible that the Eternal Son of God ſhould deſcend to the Nature of Man, than that a Man ſhould be made God, endued with a new Omniſcience to hear, and Omnipotence to grant the Prayers of all Supplicants: Then it was fruitleſs to the Enquirer's ſatisfaction,</hi> p. 31. Now <hi>p.</hi> 55. <hi>If we conſider the fruits, our thankfulneſs muſt be greater, our love more inflamed, our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence more quickned, our hatred to ſin more ſharpned, and all the good ends of Faith much more promoted: Then it was dangerous leſt we ſhould
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59637:88"/> blaſpheme,</hi> p. 36. <hi>and becauſe we have no firm ground to go upon.</hi> Now p. 55. <hi>Upon all accounts were the Scriptures ſo doubtful as to leave us to our choice, we ought rather to carry our biaſs toward our Lord's eternal Divinity, than againſt it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this and what other Diſputes may ariſe (for I have not leiſure to enquire what other Additions or Alterations are made) I doubt not but the Rector of <hi>Exeter</hi>-Colledge will ſufficiently anſwer the private Opinions of Dr. <hi>A. B.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time I am very glad to hear, and heartily congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Doctor for what he hath declared, <hi>p.</hi> 53. <hi>That though there be in the Trinity a great Myſtery, yet now nothing is more plain than that of St.</hi> John, The word became fleſh, and dwelt among us: <hi>or thoſe words of St.</hi> Paul, Great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs; God was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the fleſh: <hi>And that theſe and ſeveral other words of Scripture, ſo plainly ſpeak our Lord's Divinity, that whoever otherwiſe interprets them, will no leſs rob the words of their meaning, than Christ of his honour; And what is there in this wonderful Myſtery that Reaſon cannot comprehend,</hi> p. 54.</p>
            <p>And I hope he will make his Notion more intelligible, how a Thought, which he calls the firſt-begotten Son of God, may alſo be called the only begotten Son of God? And how a Thought or Word mental or declared, could intimately, vitally, and perfectly unite itſelf to a divinely begotten Child, which whatever he ſays to the contrary, is much more obſcure than what the Scripture, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> have ſaid.</p>
            <p>When he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 54. <hi>He can ſee no great reaſon why</hi> Socinus <hi>who contended for the Worſhip of Chriſt, ſhould alſo contend against his Eternity.</hi> I ſhould think he means he ſees no reaſon for it at all: and ſeeing he hath ſo much Charity for thoſe that altogether deny our Saviour's Deity, and dare not worſhip or invoke him at all, as not to deny them the Name of Chriſtians, or hope of Salvation, I beſeech him to extend a more affectionate and real love and good will to all ſuch as heartily profeſs to believe the one, and ſincerely devote themſelves to the practice of the other. But this ſeeming Reproof of <hi>Socinus</hi> for his Opinion concerning the Divinity of Chriſt, is no more than that for which <hi>David Franken,</hi> and others that agreed with <hi>Socinus</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his eternal Deity, did more ſeverely reprimand him for, <hi>(viz.)</hi> for worſhipping him whom he affirmed to be but a Creature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scripture. To confute and ſilence this new Notion of the Doctor, and to ſhew how much more intelligible and rational the Doctrine of the Eternal Generation of the Son of God, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> is, I ſhall inform the Reader of that
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59637:88"/> demonſtrative Explanation of it, which the learned Dr. <hi>Pearſon,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> hath elaborated.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Pearſon</hi> on the <hi>Creed, p.</hi> 267. Printed 1659. The third aſſertion to be demonſtrated is, That the Divine Eſſence which Chriſt had, as the <hi>Word,</hi> before he was conceived by the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> he had not of himſelf, but by communication from God the Father; for this can not be denied, That there can be but one Eſſence properly Divine, and ſo but one God of infinite Wiſdom, Power, and Majeſty, that there can be but one Perſon originally of himſelf ſubſiſting in that infinite Being, becauſe a Plurality of more Perſons ſo ſubſiſting would neceſſarily infer a multiplicity of Gods.—Wherefore it neceſſarily followeth, that Jeſus Chriſt, who is certainly not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cannot be a Perſon ſubſiſting in the Divine Nature originally of himſelf, and conſequently being we have already proved that he is truly and properly the Eternal God, he muſt be underſtood to have the Godhead communicated to him from the Father. All things whatever the Father hath are mine, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 16.15. Becauſe in him is the ſame fulneſs of the Godhead, and more than that the Father cannot have, <hi>p.</hi> 269. Being the Divine Nature, as it is abſolutely immaterial and incorporeal, is alſo indiviſible: Chriſt cannot have any part of it only communicated to him, but the whole, by which he muſt be acknowledged co-eſſential of the ſame Subſtance with the Father, as the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> determined, and the Fathers before them taught. Hence Chriſt ſays, <hi>I and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are one,</hi> Joh. 10.30. which raiſed a ſecond motion in the Jews to ſtone him; and though Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The Father is in me, and I in him;</hi> yet withal he ſaith, <hi>I came out from the Father;</hi> by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſhewing the Divinity of his Eſſence, by the later the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of himſelf. We muſt not look on the Divine Nature as ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rile, but rather acknowledge and admire the ſecundity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municability of itſelf, upon which the Creation of the World de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth, God making all things by his Word, to whom he firſt communicated that Omnipotency which is the cauſe of all things.</p>
            <p>The fourth aſſertion followeth, which is, That the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine Eſſence by the Father, is the Generation of the Son, and Chriſt who was eternally God, not of himſelf, but from the Father, is the Eternal Son of God. That God alway had a Son appears by <hi>Agur</hi>'s Queſtion: <hi>Who hath eſtabliſhed all the ends of the Earth? What is his Name? And what is his Son's Name, if thou canſt tell?</hi> And it was the chief deſign of <hi>Mahomet</hi> to deny this truth, becauſe he knew it was not otherwiſe poſſible to prefer himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour, wherefore he frequently inculcates that Blaſphemy
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59637:89"/> in his <hi>Alchoran,</hi> that God hath no ſuch Son nor any equal with him, and his Diſciples have corrupted the Pſalm of <hi>David, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee;</hi> into, Thou art my Prophet, I have educated thee.—But by the conſent of the ancient Jews, and the interpretation of the bleſſed Apoſtles, we know theſe words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Chriſt, and in the moſt proper ſenſe to him alone. —Now that the communication of the Divine Eſſence by the Father, was the true and proper Generation by which he hath begotten the Son, will thus appear, becauſe the moſt proper Generation which we know, is nothing elſe but a vital production of another in the ſame Nature, with a full repreſentation of him from whom he is produced: Thus Man begetteth a Son, that is, produceth another Man of the ſame humane Nature with himſelf, and this production as a perfect Generation, becomes the foundation of the relation of Paternity in him that produceth, and of Filiation in him that is produced. This is the known Confeſſion of all Men, That a Son is nothing but another produced by his Father, in the ſame Nature with him.—The ſimilitude in which the Propriety of Generation is preſerved, is that which conſiſts in identity of Nature, and this communication of the Divine Eſſence by the Father to the Word, is evidently a ſufficient foundation of ſuch a ſimilitude, from whence Chriſt is called, <hi>The Image of God; the brightneſs of his Glory, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Image of his Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then he proceeds to ſhew, That this communication of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence is a more proper Generation than any Generation of the Creatures, not only becauſe it is in a more perfect manner, but alſo becauſe the identity of Nature is moſt perfect. As in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence we acknowledge all the Perfections of the Creature, ſubſtracting all the Imperfections which adhere to them in things below; ſo in communication we muſt look upon the reality with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any kind of defect, blemiſh, or impurity. In humane Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Son is begotten in the ſame Nature with the Father, which is performed by derivation or deciſion of part of the Subſtance of the Parent, but this deciſion includeth imperfection, becauſe it ſuppoſeth the Subſtance diviſible, and conſequently corporeal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Eſſence of God is incorporeal, ſpiritual, and indiviſible, and therefore his Nature is really communicated not by derivation or deciſion, but by a total and plenary communication.</p>
            <p>In natural Generation the Father neceſſarily precedeth the Son, and begets one younger than himſelf; for ſeeing Generation is for the perpetuity of the Species, where the individuals ſucceſſively fail, it is ſufficient if the Father can produce another to live after him,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59637:89"/> and continue the exiſtence of his Nature when his Perſon is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; but this ſuppoſeth the imperfection of Mortality wholly to be removed, when we ſpeak of Him who inhabiteth Eternity, the Eſſence which God alway had without beginning; without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning he did communicate, being alway Father as alway God. Animals when they come to perfection of Nature then become pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifical; in God eternal Perfection ſhews his eternal Fecundity: And that which is moſt remarkable, in Humane Generations the Son is of the ſame nature with the Father, and yet is not the ſame Man, becauſe though he have an Eſſence of the ſame kind, yet he hath not the ſame Eſſence, the power of Generation depending on the firſt prolifical benediction; increaſe and multiply it muſt be made by way of Multiplication, and thus every Son becomes another Man: but the Divine Eſſence being by reaſon of its ſimplicity not ſubject to diviſion, and in reſpect of its infinity uncapable of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication, is ſo communicated as not to be multiplied, inſomuch, that he which proceedeth by that communication, hath not only the ſame Nature, but is the ſame God, the Father God and the Word God; <hi>Abraham</hi> Man and <hi>Iſaac</hi> Man, but <hi>Abraham</hi> one Man <hi>Iſaac</hi> another Man, not ſo the Father one God and the Son ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God, but the Father and the Word both the ſame God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then the propriety of Generation is founded in the eſſential Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the Son to the Father by reaſon of the ſame Nature which he receiveth from him, being the full perfect Nature of God is communicated to the Word, and that more intimately, and with a greater Unity and Identity than can be found in Humane Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, it follows that this communication of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the proper Generation by which Chriſt is, and is called the true and proper Son of God; this was the foundation of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Confeſſion, <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God.</hi> This the ground of our Saviour's diſtinction, <hi>I go to my Father, and to your Father.</hi> Hence did St. <hi>John</hi> raiſe a Verity more than only a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Falſity, when he ſaid, <hi>We are in the true Son, for we which are in him are true not falſe ſons, but ſuch ſons we are not as the true Son.</hi> Hence did St. <hi>Paul</hi> draw an Argument of the infinite Love of God towards Man, in that he ſpared not his own proper Son.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Multum diſtat inter dominationem &amp; conditionem inter generationem &amp; adoptionem, inter ſubſtantiam &amp; gratiam ideoque non hic permixte, nec paſſim dicitur; aſcendo ad patrem noſtrum, aut deum noſtrum, ſed ad pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem meum, &amp; patrem veſtrum, ad deum meum, &amp; ad deum veſtrum: Aliter enim deus illi pater eſt aliter nobis illum, ſiquidem natura coaequat
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59637:90" rendition="simple:additions"/> miſericordia humiliat, nos vero natura proſternat miſericordia erigit.</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preolus Carthag. Epiſt.</p>
            <p>Thus (ſaith this Incomparable Author) we have ſufficiently ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the eternal Communication of the Divine Eſſence by the Father to the Word, was the proper Generation, by which Chriſt Jeſus always was the true and proper Son of God, which was our fourth Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>And now I may hope that the Doctor will be as big as his word, not to riſe up any more againſt the Doctrine and Authority of the Church, (whereof he ſtiles himſelf a true Son) and in which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth a Power to impoſe Silence, though not Faith. <hi>To the Readers</hi> p. 7.</p>
